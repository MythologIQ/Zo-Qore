You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"}}}

Goals\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Product goals\r\n- Provide a lightweight, local first visual presence layer for agents via an animated 3D bust (head, neck, shoulders).\r\n- Support safe customization (presets + limited sliders) without requiring high end hardware.\r\n- Synchronize mouth movement to speech with graceful degradation when timing data is unavailable.\r\n- Maintain strict isolation: no impact on core agent reasoning, response latency, or Vault systems when disabled.\r\n\r\n### 1.2 Technical goals\r\n- Deterministic asset and configuration pipeline.\r\n- Bounded performance for low capability machines.\r\n- Non blocking event handling and rendering.\r\n- Pluggable quality tiers with automatic detection and user override.\r\n\r\n### 1.3 Non goals (Phase 1)\r\n- Full body avatars, IK, locomotion.\r\n- Hair or cloth physics.\r\n- Neural video synthesis or photoreal rendering.\r\n- Webcam capture or motion tracking.\r\n- Arbitrary mesh sculpting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. System Overview\r\n\r\n### 2.1 High level data flow\r\n1. Agent speech is produced (text) and optionally TTS audio.\r\n2. Synapse emits `AgentSpeechStart` with an audio reference and optional viseme timeline.\r\n3. Plugin (if enabled) updates the avatar runtime state.\r\n4. React renderer animates morph targets and minimal gestures while audio plays.\r\n5. Synapse emits `AgentSpeechEnd` and plugin returns avatar to idle.\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Isolation requirements\r\n- Plugin must not block agent responses.\r\n- Plugin must not mutate PersonaSpec or Vault memory.\r\n- Plugin must release all GPU resources on disable.\r\n- Plugin must be safe to unload at runtime.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Performance and Quality Tiers\r\n\r\nThe plugin supports three performance tiers. Each tier defines budgets and feature gates.\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Tier definitions\r\n\r\n#### Tier L (Low capability)\r\nTarget: integrated graphics, older CPUs, thin laptops.\r\n- FPS target: 24 to 30\r\n- Triangles: 4k to 8k\r\n- Textures: 512 to 1k\r\n- Draw calls: 1 to 2\r\n- Morph targets total: 8 to 12\r\n- Active visemes: 6\r\n- Lighting: baked or fixed, no shadows\r\n- Animations: idle micro sway, blink, jaw + 6 visemes\r\n- Audio analysis fallback: enabled\r\n\r\n#### Tier M (Mid capability)\r\nTarget: modern integrated graphics, average desktops.\r\n- FPS target: 30\r\n- Triangles: 8k to 15k\r\n- Textures: 1k\r\n- Draw calls: 2 to 3\r\n- Morph targets total: 12 to 18\r\n- Active visemes: 8\r\n- Lighting: fixed, optional rim, no dynamic shadows\r\n- Animations: add subtle head nods at punctuation, brow movement\r\n- Phoneme based viseme timeline: preferred\r\n\r\n#### Tier H (High capability)\r\nTarget: discrete GPU or strong iGPU.\r\n- FPS target: 60 optional, 30 minimum\r\n- Triangles: up to 25k (bust only)\r\n- Textures: 1k to 2k (2k only if stable)\r\n- Draw calls: 3 to 5\r\n- Morph targets total: up to 28\r\n- Active visemes: 10 to 12\r\n- Lighting: fixed with higher quality shading, optional soft shadow (still avoid expensive cascades)\r\n- Animations: micro expressions, gaze drift, improved smoothing\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Tier selection\r\nTier is computed at plugin enable time and can be re evaluated.\r\n\r\nInputs:\r\n- WebGL renderer string\r\n- Device memory hints (where available)\r\n- Measured render time of a built in bust benchmark scene for 2 seconds\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n- Default to Tier L if detection is uncertain.\r\n- Allow user override in plugin settings.\r\n- Persist selected tier in local settings.\r\n\r\n### 3.3 Feature gating matrix\r\n\r\n| Feature | Tier L | Tier M | Tier H |\r\n|---|---:|---:|---:|\r\n| WebGL bust render | yes | yes | yes |\r\n| Fixed camera | yes | yes | yes |\r\n| Lighting preset | 1 preset | 2 to 3 | 3 to 5 |\r\n| Dynamic shadows | no | no | optional, off by default |\r\n| Viseme count | 6 | 8 | 10 to 12 |\r\n| Brow morph | no | optional | yes |\r\n| Gaze drift | no | optional | yes |\r\n| Head nod | minimal | yes | yes |\r\n| Amplitude fallback | yes | yes | yes |\r\n| Phoneme extraction tool | optional | optional | optional |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.

Data Models\r\n\r\n### 6.1 Persistent spec\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type PerfTier = 'L' | 'M' | 'H';\r\n\r\nexport interface AvatarBustSpec {\r\n  id: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n\r\n  // Asset references\r\n  baseModelRef: string;          // relative path or asset ID\r\n  format: 'glb' | 'vrm';\r\n\r\n  // Customization parameters\r\n  materialParams: {\r\n    skin: string;   // hex or named token\r\n    hair: string;\r\n    eyes: string;\r\n    lips: string;\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  attachments: {\r\n    hairId?: string;\r\n    facialHairId?: string;\r\n    accessoryIds: string[];\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // Morphs for customization, 0..1 clamped\r\n  morphValues: Record<string, number>;\r\n\r\n  // Expression preset for preview\r\n  expressionPreset: 'neutral' | 'friendly' | 'focused' | 'stern';\r\n\r\n  // Viseme mapping, viseme token to morph target name\r\n  visemeMap: Record<string, string>;\r\n\r\n  renderPresetId: string;\r\n\r\n  // Assignments\r\n  assignedPersonaIds: string[];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 6.2 Runtime state\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface VisemeKeyframe {\r\n  timeMs: number;\r\n  viseme: string;\r\n  weight: number; // 0..1\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface BustRuntimeState {\r\n  mode: 'idle' | 'listening' | 'thinking' | 'speaking';\r\n  tier: PerfTier;\r\n\r\n  audioUrl?: string;\r\n  visemeTimeline?: VisemeKeyframe[];\r\n\r\n  intensity: number; // 0..1\r\n\r\n  // Optional debug flags\r\n  debugVisemes?: boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7. Storage and File Layout\r\n\r\n### 7.1 Local directories (Tauri app data)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<appData>/synapse/plugins/bust-avatar/\r\n  settings.json\r\n  avatar_specs.json\r\n  avatars/\r\n    <avatarId>/\r\n      model.glb\r\n      textures/\r\n      preview.png\r\n  attachments/\r\n    hair/\r\n    facial_hair/\r\n    accessories/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 7.2 Persistence rules\r\n- All specs stored as JSON in `avatar_specs.json`.\r\n- Models stored per avatar folder.\r\n- Previews generated on save.\r\n- Deleting an avatar removes its folder.\r\n- Disabling plugin does not delete data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8. Rendering Architecture (React)\r\n\r\n### 8.1 Dependencies\r\nRequired:\r\n- `three`\r\n- `@react-three/fiber`\r\n- `@react-three/drei`\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n- `@pixiv/three-vrm`\r\n\r\n### 8.2 Renderer structure\r\n- One Canvas instance per overlay.\r\n- Fixed camera framing.\r\n- Lighting preset chosen per tier.\r\n- Animation updates driven by `requestAnimationFrame` through fiber.\r\n\r\n### 8.3 Asset loading\r\n- Load base GLB once per avatar selection.\r\n- Load attachments as separate GLBs.\r\n- Cache loaded assets in memory while plugin is enabled.\r\n- Evict caches on disable.\r\n\r\n### 8.4 Morph target application\r\n- Customization morphs applied on spec load.\r\n- Visemes applied only during speaking.\r\n- Non viseme morphs must not fight visemes. Use separate morph channels or additive blending rules.\r\n\r\nRule:\r\n- If a morph target is used as both customization and viseme, customization acts as a baseline and viseme adds on top with a clamp.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9. Lip Sync Engine\r\n\r\n### 9.1 Preferred mode: timed visemes\r\nInput: `visemeTimeline`.\r\n- Sort keyframes by `timeMs`.\r\n- Drive morph targets using easing between keyframes.\r\n\r\nEasing:\r\n- Tier L: linear with smoothing window\r\n- Tier M: smoothstep\r\n- Tier H: cubic ease with coarticulation smoothing\r\n\r\nCoarticulation:\r\n- Tier L: none\r\n- Tier M: short overlap blend\r\n- Tier H: overlap + anticipation for next viseme\r\n\r\n### 9.2 Fallback mode: amplitude jaw\r\nInput: audio amplitude envelope.\r\n- Compute RMS over 20 to 30 ms windows.\r\n- Map RMS to jaw open morph with clamp.\r\n\r\nTier differences:\r\n- Tier L: lower update frequency (20 to 24 Hz)\r\n- Tier M: 30 Hz\r\n- Tier H: 60 Hz optional\r\n\r\n### 9.3 Optional phoneme extraction\r\nIf TTS does not provide timing and the user enables local extraction:\r\n- Rust invokes a CLI tool.\r\n- Tool output is converted to viseme timeline.\r\n- Strict timeout, default 2 seconds.\r\n- If timeout or failure, fall back to amplitude.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 10. Animation Layer\r\n\r\n### 10.1 Idle loop\r\n- Subtle sway and breathing.\r\n- Loop duration 4 to 8 seconds with randomized phase.\r\n\r\n### 10.2 Blinks\r\n- Random intervals 2.5 to 6 seconds.\r\n- Slight variation per tier.\r\n\r\n### 10.3 Head nods\r\n- Triggered at punctuation boundaries when text is available.\r\n- Tier L: disabled or minimal.\r\n- Tier M and H: short nod at sentence end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 11. Customization System\r\n\r\n### 11.1 Allowed customization in Phase 1\r\n- Material colors: skin, hair, eyes, lips.\r\n- Preset mesh attachments: hair, facial hair, accessories.\r\n- Facial morph sliders: 8 to 12.\r\n- Expression presets: sets of morph weights.\r\n\r\n### 11.2 Attachment anchoring\r\n- All base models must include named anchor nodes:\r\n  - `ANCHOR_HAIR`\r\n  - `ANCHOR_GLASSES`\r\n  - `ANCHOR_EARRING_L`\r\n  - `ANCHOR_EARRING_R`\r\n  - `ANCHOR_HEADSET`\r\n\r\nAttachment meshes are positioned relative to anchors.\r\n\r\n### 11.3 Morph contract\r\nA minimal required morph set per base model:\r\n- `jawOpen`\r\n- `mouthSmile`\r\n- `blinkLeft`\r\n- `blinkRight`\r\n\r\nRecommended morphs for Tier M and H:\r\n- `browUp`\r\n- `browDown`\r\n- `mouthFrown`\r\n- `cheekPuff`\r\n\r\nViseme morphs must be mapped via `visemeMap` and may vary by model name.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 12. Plugin Settings\r\n\r\n### 12.1 Settings schema\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface BustAvatarPluginSettings {\r\n  enabled: boolean;\r\n  tier: 'auto' | 'L' | 'M' | 'H';\r\n  showOverlayInAgentView: boolean;\r\n  defaultRenderPresetId: string;\r\n  lipSyncMode: 'auto' | 'timed' | 'amplitude';\r\n  exaggeration: number; // 0..1\r\n  smoothing: number;    // 0..1\r\n  allowLocalPhonemeTool: boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 12.2 Defaults\r\n- enabled: false\r\n- tier: auto\r\n- lipSyncMode: auto\r\n- allowLocalPhonemeTool: false\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 13. Failure Modes and Degradation\r\n\r\n### 13.1 WebGL unavailable\r\n- Plugin shows a static placeholder and disables overlay rendering.\r\n- Avatar Studio remains accessible for managing assets.\r\n\r\n### 13.2 Context loss\r\n- Auto unmount canvas.\r\n- Offer a restart overlay button.\r\n- Do not crash core.\r\n\r\n### 13.3 Asset load failure\r\n- Fallback to neutral bust placeholder.\r\n- Surface error in Avatar Studio.\r\n\r\n### 13.4 Low FPS detected\r\n- Auto downshift tier from H to M or M to L.\r\n- Persist the downshift suggestion but do not override user forced tier unless explicitly allowed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 14. Security and Privacy\r\n\r\n- All avatar assets remain local by default.\r\n- No telemetry required.\r\n- If any optional cloud features are added later, they must be opt in and clearly labeled.\r\n- No camera or microphone access required beyond audio playback.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 15. Testing Strategy (Unit and Deterministic)\r\n\r\nNo manual testing requirements in this plan.\r\n\r\n### 15.1 Frontend unit tests\r\n- `visemeTimeline` sorting and interpolation logic.\r\n- Easing functions per tier.\r\n- Morph application clamping and baseline plus viseme composition.\r\n- Tier selection logic given mocked benchmark results.\r\n\r\n### 15.2 Backend unit tests\r\n- Settings JSON read and write.\r\n- Avatar spec persistence and folder layout creation.\r\n- CLI invocation wrapper for phoneme extraction using a stubbed command runner.\r\n\r\n### 15.3 Determinism tests\r\n- Given a fixed timeline and settings, produced morph weights at sampled timestamps are identical.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 16. Implementation Notes for Workers\r\n\r\n### 16.1 Recommended package set (frontend)\r\n- three\r\n- @react-three/fiber\r\n- @react-three/drei\r\n- optional: @pixiv/three-vrm\r\n\r\n### 16.2 Tauri capabilities\r\n- Local filesystem access for plugin data directories.\r\n- Process spawn with allow list for optional phoneme tool.\r\n\r\n### 16.3 Timeouts\r\n- CLI phoneme extraction must have a strict timeout.\r\n- Audio analysis windowing must not exceed small CPU budgets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 17. Open Decisions\r\n\r\nThese are intentionally left as decisions for the product and engineering review:\r\n1. Whether to adopt VRM as a first class supported input in Phase 1 or keep it as Phase 2.\r\n2. Whether to ship with a bundled phoneme tool for offline timed visemes.\r\n3. Whether to display a performance meter to users or keep it developer only.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 18. Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nPhase 1 is complete when:\r\n- Plugin can be enabled and disabled at runtime.\r\n- Avatar Studio can create a bust avatar from templates and persist it.\r\n- Overlay renderer displays the assigned avatar.\r\n- During speech, mouth movement is synchronized via timed visemes when available.\r\n- When timed visemes are not available, amplitude jaw fallback runs.\r\n- On low capability machines, Tier L maintains stable 24 to 30 FPS and never degrades core agent performance.\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Executive Summary\r\nThe Bust Avatar Presence Plugin provides a lightweight, local-first, animated 3D bust (head/shoulders) that visually represents an agent/persona and lip-syncs to speech. The plugin is fully optional, performance-bounded for low-power systems, and isolated from core reasoning and memory systems. When disabled, it has zero runtime footprint.\r\n\r\n## 2. Objectives\r\nProvide believable visual presence (blink, idle, lip-sync, subtle head motion).\r\n\r\nEnable safe, performant customization (colors, presets, limited sliders).\r\n\r\nPreserve privacy and offline operation by default.\r\n\r\nMaintain strict dependency and performance isolation from core systems.\r\n\r\n## 3. Non-Goals (Phase 1)\r\nFull-body avatars or locomotion\r\n\r\nPhotoreal / neural video synthesis\r\n\r\nHair/cloth physics\r\n\r\nWebcam capture or motion tracking\r\n\r\nMultiplayer/networked avatars\r\n\r\nFree-form mesh sculpting\r\n\r\n## 4.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Performance Checklist (Technical Acceptance)\r\nThis checklist is required before Phase 1 is declared complete.\r\n\r\n- Tier budgets enforced: triangle, texture, morph target, draw call limits per tier.\r\n- Texture compression enabled for all tiers (required for M and H).\r\n- LODs available for M and H; L tier uses lowest LOD only.\r\n- No per-frame allocations in render or animation loops.\r\n- Lip-sync update rate capped per tier (L: 20-24 Hz, M: 30 Hz, H: 60 Hz max).\r\n- Idle animation update rate capped at 24 Hz for L, 30 Hz for M/H.\r\n- CPU budget per frame met (L: < 2 ms, M: < 3 ms, H: < 4 ms) for animation + visemes.\r\n- GPU memory budget per avatar met (L: 20-30 MB, M: 30-45 MB, H: 45-80 MB).\r\n- Cache eviction on avatar change and plugin disable verified.\r\n- Downshift occurs after 5 seconds of sustained low FPS; no auto-upshift.\r\n- WebGL context loss handled without crashing core.\r\n- Phoneme extraction never runs on the speech pipeline.\r\n- Plugin disable removes all GPU resources and stops animation loops.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 17. Open Decisions\r\n\r\nThese are intentionally left as decisions for the product and engineering review:\r\n1. Whether to adopt VRM as a first class supported input in Phase 1 or keep it as Phase 2.\r\n2. Whether to ship with a bundled phoneme tool for offline timed visemes.\r\n3. Whether to display a performance meter to users or keep it developer only.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 18. Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nPhase 1 is complete when:\r\n- Plugin can be enabled and disabled at runtime.\r\n- Avatar Studio can create a bust avatar from templates and persist it.\r\n- Overlay renderer displays the assigned avatar.\r\n- During speech, mouth movement is synchronized via timed visemes when available.\r\n- When timed visemes are not available, amplitude jaw fallback runs.\r\n- On low capability machines, Tier L maintains stable 24 to 30 FPS and never degrades core agent performance.\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

{"timestamp":"2026-02-03T05:59:01.199Z","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"agent_message","message":"**Adversarial Review (Strict Performance/Quality Evaluator)**\n\n**High severity**\n- **Budget compliance is not enforceable yet.** You define CPU/GPU/memory budgets, but there is no concrete, testable instrumentation path in the spec (what tool, where data is recorded, pass/fail thresholds per tier). This makes the budgets aspirational rather than enforceable. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n- **Tier downshift logic is brittle.** You defined FPS thresholds, but they are still generic and don’t include p95 frame time or a stable hysteresis mechanism, so you’re at risk of oscillation or misclassifying transient spikes. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n- **Asset pipeline and runtime responsibilities are still conceptually conflated.** Fabricator “creates and validates,” but the plugin still implicitly assumes morph target correctness and tier assets exist. There’s no fail-closed behavior described if Fabricator outputs are missing LODs or compressed textures. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n\n**Medium severity**\n- **Texture compression is underspecified for platform variability.** You mention BasisU/KTX2 but don’t define required codec targets per platform. This is a real performance risk because wrong targets will cause runtime fallback to uncompressed textures. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n- **Attachment caps are weakly enforced.** You introduced caps per tier, but there’s no rule for how to resolve conflicts if the user exceeds caps (auto-disable? prompt? silent drop?).

This makes the budgets aspirational rather than enforceable. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n- **Tier downshift logic is brittle.** You defined FPS thresholds, but they are still generic and don’t include p95 frame time or a stable hysteresis mechanism, so you’re at risk of oscillation or misclassifying transient spikes. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n- **Asset pipeline and runtime responsibilities are still conceptually conflated.** Fabricator “creates and validates,” but the plugin still implicitly assumes morph target correctness and tier assets exist. There’s no fail-closed behavior described if Fabricator outputs are missing LODs or compressed textures. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n\n**Medium severity**\n- **Texture compression is underspecified for platform variability.** You mention BasisU/KTX2 but don’t define required codec targets per platform. This is a real performance risk because wrong targets will cause runtime fallback to uncompressed textures. File: `docs/Conceptual/bust_avatar_presence_plugin_technical_spec.md`\n- **Attachment caps are weakly enforced.** You introduced caps per tier, but there’s no rule for how to resolve conflicts if the user exceeds caps (auto-disable? prompt? silent drop?).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
