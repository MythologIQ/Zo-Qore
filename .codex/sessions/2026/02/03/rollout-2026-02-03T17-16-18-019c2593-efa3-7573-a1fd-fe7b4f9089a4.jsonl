You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Only engineering truth.\\n\\nHearthlink CORE Runtime\\n\\nContained • Offline • Restricted • Execution\\n\\nLocal Inference Runtime Architecture\\nVersion 1.0\\n\\n1. Purpose\\n\\nThe CORE Runtime is Hearthlink’s local, secure inference engine.\\n\\nIt provides deterministic model execution while enforcing strict isolation from:\\n\\nsystem data\\n\\nexternal networks\\n\\nplugins\\n\\ngovernance logic\\n\\nmemory stores\\n\\nIt exists solely to:\\n\\nconvert tokens to tokens safely and locally.\\n\\nThe runtime performs compute only.\\nAll policy, permissions, and data ownership remain outside this component.\\n\\n2. Design Principles\\n\\nThe CORE Runtime follows four non-negotiable constraints.\\n\\nContained\\n\\nRuns inside a sandbox with no ambient privileges.\\n\\nOffline\\n\\nNo inbound or outbound network access.\\n\\nRestricted\\n\\nOnly accepts requests from Hearthlink through authenticated IPC.\\n\\nExecution\\n\\nPerforms inference only. No business logic or decision authority.\\n\\nIf the runtime ever performs anything beyond execution, it violates its design.\\n\\n3. Scope\\nResponsibilities (ONLY these)\\n\\nLoad models\\n\\nTokenize inputs\\n\\nRun inference\\n\\nStream tokens\\n\\nManage GPU/CPU memory\\n\\nSwap models\\n\\nSchedule concurrent inference sessions\\n\\nReturn outputs\\n\\nExplicitly Out of Scope\\n\\nThe runtime must NOT:\\n\\nread Vault\\n\\nwrite files outside temp/model dirs\\n\\naccess Synapse\\n\\ncall plugins\\n\\nmake HTTP requests\\n\\nmanage permissions\\n\\nperform governance\\n\\norchestrate workflows\\n\\nstore persistent memory\\n\\nThose belong to other modules.\\n\\n4. Trust Model\\nTrust Assumptions\\n\\nThe runtime is:\\n\\ntrusted for computation\\n\\nnot trusted for authority\\n\\nIt is treated as:\\n\\nhigh complexity\\n\\nthird-party heavy\\n\\ndifficult to audit\\n\\nTherefore:\\n\\nit receives minimal privileges.\\n\\nNot because it is hostile.\\nBecause its blast radius must be small.\\n\\n5.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The persona files are guidance, not isolated agents. Route manually using the slash commands below, or use Claude Code's built-in Task tool agents when you need true isolation.\r\n\r\nTo ensure persona context is loaded, each `/ql-*` skill now reads a matching persona skill file (for example, `.claude/commands/ql-judge-persona.md`).\r\n\r\nWhen routing manually, use these path-based guidelines:\r\n\r\n| Path Pattern | Routed Persona | Enforcement |\r\n|--------------|----------------|-------------|\r\n| `*/security/*`, `*/auth/*` | Judge | L3 lockdown, formal review |\r\n| `*/src/*`, `*/components/*` | Specialist | 40-line razor |\r\n| `*/docs/*` | Governor | Merkle chain verification |\r\n\r\n## Merkle Chain Traceability\r\n\r\nEvery significant decision is cryptographically linked:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEntry #1 (Genesis)\r\n  hash: SHA256(CONCEPT.md + ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md)\r\n\r\nEntry #2 (Audit)\r\n  hash: SHA256(AUDIT_REPORT.md + Entry#1.hash)\r\n\r\nEntry #3 (Implementation)\r\n  hash: SHA256(src/* changes + Entry#2.hash)\r\n\r\nEntry #4 (Seal)\r\n  hash: SHA256(final state + Entry#3.hash)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Migration from Zo\r\n\r\nIf you have an existing Zo configuration:\r\n\r\n1. The persona definitions map directly to subagents\r\n2. The prompts become skills (slash commands)\r\n3. The JSON rules become hooks + skill enforcement\r\n4. Document templates remain compatible\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### \"Gate locked. Tribunal audit required.\"\r\nRun `/ql-audit` to generate a PASS/VETO verdict before implementation.\r\n\r\n### \"Chain Broken at Entry #X\"\r\nThe Merkle chain has been tampered with or corrupted. Manual audit required.\r\n\r\n### \"Complexity razor triggered\"\r\nYour code exceeds KISS constraints. Run `/ql-refactor` for automatic simplification.\r\n\r\n### \"Target file appears orphaned\"\r\nThe file is not connected to the build path. Verify imports or remove dead code.\r\n"}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Main branch architecture\n1.1 Non-negotiable contract\n\nCORE Runtime is compute only: tokens in, tokens out, no authority, no network, minimal filesystem. \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\n \n\nCONCEPT\n\n1.2 Process placement and boundaries\n\nMain branch must enforce the architecture you wrote:\n\nSeparate OS process, never embedded. \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\nNamed IPC only, no HTTP/ports. \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\n \n\nARCHITECTURE_PLAN\n\nNetwork blocked inbound and outbound. \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\nFilesystem allowlist:\n\nRead: models/, tokenizers/\n\nWrite: temp/, cache/\n\nDeny all else \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\n \n\nARCHITECTURE_PLAN\n\nNo persistent memory store inside CORE. \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\n \n\nCONCEPT\n\n1.3 Module layout as the stable spine\n\nKeep the sealed module tree as the Main architecture baseline. \n\nSYSTEM_STATE\n\nipc/: auth, protocol validation, handler routing \n\nSYSTEM_STATE\n\nscheduler/: queue, priority, batching \n\nSYSTEM_STATE\n\nengine/: tokenizer, inference, streaming \n\nSYSTEM_STATE\n\nmodels/: loader, registry, swap \n\nSYSTEM_STATE\n\nmemory/: pool, gpu tracking, cache \n\nSYSTEM_STATE\n\nDependencies stay as currently approved in SYSTEM_STATE. \n\nSYSTEM_STATE\n\n1.4 Main branch invariants\n\nThese are “never break” rules for Main:\n\nIPC validation happens before allocation and before scheduler enqueue. \n\nARCHITECTURE_PLAN\n\nHard caps exist for:\n\nmax prompt token count\n\nmax request bytes\n\nmax output tokens\n\nmax queue depth\n\nmax concurrent sessions \n\nARCHITECTURE_PLAN\n\nCrash-safe behavior: fail closed, restartable, no content logging. \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\nModels treated as untrusted blobs; validate on load, never grant privileges. \n\nCORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE\n\n2.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Not finalized. Must pass `ql-plan` and `ql-audit` before any implementation.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThis proposal defines a tandem approach where `main` remains the hardened runtime and experimental work occurs on controlled `exp/<slug>` branches with measurable gates and one-commit rollback.\\n\\n## 1. Main Branch Architecture\\n\\n### 1.1 Non-Negotiable Contract\\n\\n- CORE Runtime is compute only: tokens in, tokens out, no authority, no network, minimal filesystem.\\n- See: `docs/architecture/CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONCEPT.md`.\\n\\n### 1.2 Process Placement and Boundaries\\n\\nMain branch must enforce:\\n\\n- Separate OS process, never embedded. (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE)\\n- Named IPC only, no HTTP/ports. (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE, ARCHITECTURE_PLAN)\\n- Network blocked inbound and outbound. (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE)\\n- Filesystem allowlist:\\n  - Read: `models/`, `tokenizers/`\\n  - Write: `temp/`, `cache/`\\n  - Deny all else (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE, ARCHITECTURE_PLAN)\\n- No persistent memory store inside CORE. (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE, CONCEPT)\\n\\n### 1.3 Module Layout as Stable Spine\\n\\nKeep the sealed module tree as the `main` architecture baseline:\\n\\n- `ipc/`: auth, protocol validation, handler routing\\n- `scheduler/`: queue, priority, batching\\n- `engine/`: tokenizer, inference, streaming\\n- `models/`: loader, registry, swap\\n- `memory/`: pool, GPU tracking, cache\\n\\nDependencies must remain as currently approved in `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`.\\n\\n### 1.4 Main Branch Invariants\\n\\nNever break rules for `main`:\\n\\n- IPC validation happens before allocation and before scheduler enqueue. (ARCHITECTURE_PLAN)\\n- Hard caps exist for:\\n  - max prompt token count\\n  - max request bytes\\n  - max output tokens\\n  - max queue depth\\n  - max concurrent sessions (ARCHITECTURE_PLAN)\\n- Crash-safe behavior: fail closed, restartable, no content logging. (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE)\\n- Models treated as untrusted blobs; validate on load, never grant privileges. (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE)\\n\\n## 2. Fail-Fast Experiment Framework (Parallel Track)\\n\\n### 2.1 Branching Strategy\\n\\n- `main`: hardened runtime only.\\n- Experiment branches: `exp/<slug>`.\\n- Rule: experiments merge to `main` only after passing gates. Otherwise delete the branch. This preserves one-revert rollback.\\n\\n### 2.2 Experiment Boundaries\\n\\nExperiments may touch only one surface at a time:\\n\\n- `memory/` representation, pooling, cache strategies\\n- `scheduler/` batching and queue behavior\\n- `models/` load-time transformations\\n- `engine/` kernel selection and layout choices\\n\\nExperiments must not introduce:\\n\\n- new network code\\n- new filesystem traversal\\n- new authority or persistence behaviors (ARCHITECTURE_PLAN, CONCEPT)\\n\\n### 2.3 Standard Experiment Harness (Required)\\n\\nAdd a benchmark layer that does not change production behavior:\\n\\n- `benches/` (Criterion or minimal internal harness)\\n- `fixtures/` with:\\n  - representative prompts (small, medium, large)\\n  - representative model set (at least one small model for fast iteration)\\n- Metrics emitted as numbers only:\\n  - tokens per second\\n  - p50/p95 latency\\n  - peak RSS\\n  - peak VRAM (if relevant)\\n  - allocations per request (if measurable)\\n  - queue wait time (scheduler experiments)\\n\\nOutput must be machine-readable for CI comparison.\\n\\n### 2.4 Experiment Gates\\n\\nSecurity gates:\\n\\n- No new dependencies outside the approved list. (SYSTEM_STATE)\\n- No new forbidden modules. (ARCHITECTURE_PLAN)\\n- IPC limits and validation unchanged or strengthened. (ARCHITECTURE_PLAN)\\n- No logging of prompts or tokens. (CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE)\\n\\nCorrectness gates:\\n\\n- Property tests: encode then decode returns original (for any encoding experiment)\\n- Determinism test: same model + same tokens + same params yields identical outputs across N runs (within defined tolerance if using sampling)\\n- Existing TDD-light tests remain green. (META_LEDGER, SYSTEM_STATE)\\n\\nPerformance gates:\\n\\nMust show improvement on at least one primary metric without unacceptable regression in others:\\n\\n- tokens/sec improves by at least 5–10%\\n- memory reduces by at least 10%\\n- p95 latency does not worsen by more than 3–5%\\n\\nIf gains are within noise, declare “no decision” and delete or re-scope the experiment.\\n\\n### 2.5 Traceability Rules for Main Merges\\n\\nEvery merged experiment must update traceability artifacts:\\n\\n- `FEATURE_MAP.md`: new capability or change recorded\\n- `FEATURE_BUILD_PLANS.md`: plan item marked complete with commit or PR reference\\n- Link to `exp/<slug>` and acceptance metrics\\n\\nIf these do not exist yet, create minimal stubs to enforce discipline.\\n\\n## 3. First Fail-Fast Experiment (001)\\n\\n### Experiment 001: IPC Payload and Token Buffer Packing\\n\\nGoal:\\n\\n- Reduce request payload size and memory bandwidth by tightening token representation.\\n\\nWhy it fits:\\n\\n- Touches IPC protocol and internal buffers, not model math.\\n- Fully gated with property tests and benchmark metrics.\\n- Reverts cleanly if it underperforms.\\n\\nScope:\\n\\n- Add alternate protocol message format version:\\n  - `v1`: `Vec<u32>` tokens\\n  - `v2`: packed varint or `u16` where possible, with fallback for larger token IDs\\n- Decode at IPC boundary into existing `Vec<u32>` initially\\n\\nSuccess metrics:\\n\\n- IPC request bytes reduced by at least 30% on typical prompts\\n- p95 latency not worse by more than 3%\\n- no increase in allocation count per request\\n\\nIf it passes:\\n\\n- Consider second-step experiment to keep packed tokens deeper into scheduler queues to reduce memory further\\n\\nIf it fails:\\n\\n- Delete branch\\n- Keep benchmark harness\\n\\nThis experiment aligns with strict IPC and schema validation emphasis in ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.\\n\\n## 4. Tandem Execution Plan (Sequence, No Dates)\\n\\n1. Lock Main invariants.\\n2. Document invariants as a short checklist in the repo.\\n3. Add CI checks that fail if forbidden dependencies appear. (SYSTEM_STATE, ARCHITECTURE_PLAN)\\n4. Add benchmark harness to `main` (`benches/` + `fixtures/` + simple runner).\\n5. Run Experiment 001 branch.\\n6. Implement v2 protocol and decode boundary.\\n7. Add property tests and bench comparisons.\\n8. Merge only if gates pass.\\n9. Repeat with next experiments ranked by payoff:\\n   - KV cache memory layout\\n   - allocator pooling improvements\\n   - scheduler micro-batching heuristics\\n\\n'@ | Set-Content -Path docs/TANDEM_EXPERIMENTS_PROPOSAL.md\\n\"}","call_id":"call_tZwFYq0XavzJwlwgEiiIzGyx"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
