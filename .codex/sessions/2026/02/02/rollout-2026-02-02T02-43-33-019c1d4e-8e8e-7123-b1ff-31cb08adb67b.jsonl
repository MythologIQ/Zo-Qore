You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Significantly improved the conversational naturalness of Alden by removing programmatic headers and internal monologue from the chat UI.\r\n\r\n### 1. Login Screen Redesign\r\n\r\n- Applied the official Hearthlink logo with a cyan glow.\r\n- Added a subtle textured background overlay (`obsidian-bg.png`).\r\n\r\n### 2. Bridge Resilience (Fixed)\r\n\r\n- Solved the recurring \"Authentication failed\" loop. The bridge now correctly catches missing credentials, auto-refreshes them in development, and retries the failed command seamlessly.\r\n- Fixed a scoping bug in `BaseBridge.ts` where `payload` was inaccessible during the retry phase.\r\n\r\n### 3. Alden Persona Naturalization\r\n\r\n- Removed `[Analysis]` and `[Instruction]` tags that were programmatically prepended to Alden's responses.\r\n- Backend intelligence (memory indexing) remains fully functional but silent.\r\n- **Constraint:** User reported that the model potentially \"didn't respond\" in the final test. This may be a Llama 3.2 timeout or an issue with the stricter system prompt constraints.\r\n\r\n## 🚧 Blockers / Pending Items\r\n\r\n- **LLM Responsiveness**: Need to verify if the LLM is responding appropriately to the new conversational constraints or if it's hitting a timeout in the Python subprocess.\r\n- **Voice Studio Integration**: Ensure the new branding doesn't conflict with any Voice Studio UI assets.\r\n\r\n## 🛠️ Commands for Next Session\r\n\r\n- `npm run tauri:dev` - Run the app and test the Alden chat responsiveness.\r\n- Check `src-tauri/src/alden_legacy.rs` logs if subprocess communication fails.\r\n"}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\nAI Agents tend to:\r\n\r\n- Over-engineer solutions (Factory patterns for simple functions).\r\n- Write \"Clever\" one-liners that are unreadable.\r\n- Create \"God Objects\" (e.g., `Utilities.ts`).\r\n- Hallucinate dependencies (installing a library for a 1-line math function).\r\n\r\n## 2. THE RULES (The \"Anti-Bloat\" Constitution)\r\n\r\n### Rule 1: The \"Screen Test\" (Size Limits)\r\n\r\n- **Functions:** Must fit on one screen (~50 lines). If longer -> **Extract Sub-function**.\r\n- **Files:** Should be specialized. If a file hits 300 lines -> **Propose Split**.\r\n- **Indentation:** specific limit of 3 levels deep. If `if { for { if } }` -> **Return Early** or **Extract**.\r\n\r\n### Rule 2: Explicit > Clever\r\n\r\n- **BANNED:** Nested Ternaries (`a ? b : c ? d : e`).\r\n- **BANNED:** Obscure Bitwise operations (unless low-level/embedded).\r\n- **REQUIRED:** Variable names must be `noun` or `verbNoun`. No `x`, `data`, `obj`.\r\n\r\n### Rule 3: The \"YAGNI\" Filter (You Ain't Gonna Need It)\r\n\r\n- Do **NOT** build generic \"Handlers\" for a single use-case.\r\n- Do **NOT** add configuration options that are not requested.\r\n- **Strict Mode:** Implementation must satisfy _only_ the current requirement.\r\n\r\n### Rule 4: Dependency Diet\r\n\r\n- **Check:** Before `npm install x`:\r\n  - Can this be done in vanilla JS/TS in < 10 lines?\r\n  - **IF YES:** Write the function. Do not install the bloat.\r\n\r\n## 3. EXECUTION (The \"Simplification Pass\")\r\n\r\n**Trigger:** Before marking a task `COMPLETE`.\r\n\r\n**Action:**\r\n\r\n1.  **Read** the code you just wrote.\r\n2.  **Ask:** \"Can I delete anything?\"\r\n3.  **Ask:** \"If I handed this to a Junior Dev, would they cry?\"\r\n4.  **Refactor:** Rename variables, break up long lines, add JSDoc/Comments for _Why_ (not What).\r\n\r\n## 4. REVIEW PROMPTS (Internal Audit)\r\n\r\nWhen running `internal_audit`, the **Specialist** must ask:\r\n\r\n- \"Is this the simplest thing that could possibly work?\"\r\n- \"Are we introducing accidental complexity?\"\r\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
