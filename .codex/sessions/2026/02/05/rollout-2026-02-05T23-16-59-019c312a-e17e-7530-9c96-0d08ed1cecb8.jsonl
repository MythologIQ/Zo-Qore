You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Applies OS concepts to AI agent governance.\r\n\r\n**Key Features:**\r\n\r\n- 4-layer kernel architecture (Primitives, Communication, Control Plane, Execution)\r\n- POSIX-inspired primitives (signals, VFS, IPC)\r\n- Application-level middleware for action interception\r\n- Cross-model verification (CMVK)\r\n- Inter-agent trust protocol (IATP)\r\n- Episodic memory kernel\r\n- Framework integrations (LangChain, OpenAI, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel)\r\n- MCP server for Claude/Copilot/Cursor\r\n- OpenAI Agents SDK integration\r\n\r\n**Technology Stack:**\r\n\r\n- Python 3.10+\r\n- SQLite (Flight Recorder)\r\n- Prometheus + OpenTelemetry\r\n- Redis/Kafka/NATS (message bus adapters)\r\n- Docker\r\n\r\n**Core Modules:**\r\n\r\n- `control-plane`: THE KERNEL (policy engine, signals)\r\n- `cmvk`: Cross-model verification\r\n- `amb`: Agent message bus\r\n- `iatp`: Inter-agent trust protocol\r\n- `emk`: Episodic memory kernel\r\n- `scak`: Self-correcting agent kernel\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Comparative Statistics\r\n\r\n### Language Distribution\r\n\r\n- **FailSafe:** TypeScript/Node.js (IDE extension focus)\r\n- **AgentMesh:** Python (cloud-native infrastructure)\r\n- **Agent OS:** Python (kernel/middleware)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n- **FailSafe:** MIT\r\n- **AgentMesh:** Apache 2.0\r\n- **Agent OS:** MIT\r\n\r\n### Maturity\r\n\r\n- **FailSafe:** Beta (v2.0.1) - Production-ready extension\r\n- **AgentMesh:** Alpha (Q1 2026) - Active development\r\n- **Agent OS:** Research - Core production-ready, extensions experimental\r\n\r\n### Focus Area\r\n\r\n- **FailSafe:** IDE/Developer experience (VS Code)\r\n- **AgentMesh:** Cloud-native multi-agent coordination\r\n- **Agent OS:** Kernel-level governance primitives\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Common Themes\r\n\r\n### 1. Rejection of Prompt-Based Safety\r\n\r\nAll three repos emphasize **deterministic enforcement** over asking LLMs to follow rules:\r\n\r\n- **FailSafe:** \"Kernel-style safety evaluates actions at the editor boundary using policies, heuristics, and optional LLM analysis.\"\r\n- **AgentMesh:** \"A2A gives agents a common language. MCP gives agents tools. Neither enforces trust.\"\r\n- **Agent OS:** \"Kernel-based safety intercepts actions before execution. The policy engine decides, not the LLM.\"\r\n\r\n### 2. MCP Integration\r\n\r\nAll three integrate with the Model Context Protocol:\r\n\r\n- **FailSafe:** MCP Server for AI agents\r\n- **AgentMesh:** MCP proxy for transparent governance\r\n- **Agent OS:** MCP kernel server for Claude/Copilot/Cursor\r\n\r\n### 3.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The LLM decides whether to comply.\r\n\r\n**Kernel-style safety** evaluates actions at the editor boundary using policies, heuristics, and optional LLM analysis.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TD\r\n    A[User Actions] --> B[Intent Service]\r\n    B --> C{Enforcement}\r\n    C -- Allowed --> D[File System]\r\n    C -- Blocked --> E[User Approval]\r\n\r\n    F[AI Agent] --> G[MCP Server]\r\n    G --> H[Sentinel Audit]\r\n    H --> I[SOA Ledger]\r\n\r\n    I --> J[Genesis Dashboard]\r\n    H --> J\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Directory Structure\r\n\r\nFailSafe uses a **Physical Isolation** model to separate workspace governance from application development.\r\n\r\n### Workspace Root (Governance)\r\n\r\n```\r\n/ (root)\r\n├── .agent/                   # Active workspace workflows\r\n├── .claude/                  # Active commands + secure tokens\r\n├── .qorelogic/               # Workspace configuration (locked)\r\n├── docs/                     # Workspace governance (Ledger, State, Spec)\r\n└── FAILSAFE_SPECIFICATION.md -> docs/FAILSAFE_SPECIFICATION.md\r\n```\r\n\r\n### App Container (Extension Source)\r\n\r\n```\r\n/FailSafe/ (container)\r\n├── extension/                # VSCode Extension TypeScript Project\r\n├── Antigravity/              # Gemini + Claude workflows (source)\r\n├── VSCode/                   # Copilot + Claude prompts (source)\r\n├── PROD-Extension/           # Production builds (includes Claude)\r\n│   ├── Antigravity/          # → OpenVSX (Gemini + Claude)\r\n│   └── VSCode/               # → VS Code Marketplace (Copilot + Claude)\r\n└── build/                    # Build & validation tooling\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** Claude Code is no longer a separate build.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

MCP gives agents tools. Neither enforces trust.**\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\nAgentMesh provides:\r\n\r\n| Capability | Description |\r\n|------------|-------------|\r\n| **Agent Identity** | First-class identity with human sponsor accountability |\r\n| **Ephemeral Credentials** | 15-minute TTL by default, auto-rotation |\r\n| **Protocol Bridge** | Native A2A, MCP, IATP with unified trust model |\r\n| **Reward Engine** | Continuous behavioral scoring, not static rules |\r\n| **Compliance Automation** | EU AI Act, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR mapping |\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Secure Claude Desktop (Recommended)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Install AgentMesh\r\npip install agentmesh-platform\r\n\r\n# Set up Claude Desktop to use AgentMesh governance\r\nagentmesh init-integration --claude\r\n\r\n# Restart Claude Desktop - all MCP tools are now secured!\r\n```\r\n\r\nClaude will now route tool calls through AgentMesh for policy enforcement and trust scoring.\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Create a Governed Agent\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Initialize a governed agent in 30 seconds\r\nagentmesh init --name my-agent --sponsor alice@company.com\r\n\r\n# Register with the mesh\r\nagentmesh register\r\n\r\n# Start with governance enabled\r\nagentmesh run\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 3: Wrap Any MCP Server\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Proxy any MCP server with governance\r\nagentmesh proxy --target npx --target -y \\\r\n  --target @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem \\\r\n  --target /path/to/directory\r\n\r\n# Use strict policy (blocks writes/deletes)\r\nagentmesh proxy --policy strict --target <your-mcp-server>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install agentmesh-platform\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr install with extra dependencies:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install agentmesh-platform[server]  # FastAPI server\r\npip install agentmesh-platform[dev]     # Development tools\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr from source:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/imran-siddique/agent-mesh.git\r\ncd agent-mesh\r\npip install -e .\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples & Integrations\r\n\r\n**Real-world examples** to get started quickly:\r\n\r\n| Example | Use Case | Key Features |\r\n|---------|----------|--------------|\r\n| [MCP Tool Server](./examples/01-mcp-tool-server/) | Secure MCP server with governance | Rate limiting, output sanitization, audit logs |\r\n| [Multi-Agent Customer Service](./examples/02-customer-service/) | Customer support automation | Delegation chains, trust handshakes, A2A |\r\n| [Healthcare HIPAA](./examples/03-healthcare-hipaa/) | HIPAA-compliant data analysis | Compliance automation, PHI protection, Merkle audit |\r\n| [GitHub PR Review](./examples/05-github-integration/) | Code review agent | Output policies, shadow mode, trust decay |\r\n\r\n**Framework integrations:**\r\n- **[Claude Desktop](./docs/integrations/claude-desktop.md)** - Secure MCP tools with one command\r\n- [LangChain Integration](./examples/integrations/langchain.md) - Secure LangChain agents with policies\r\n- [CrewAI Integration](./examples/integrations/crewai.md) - Multi-agent crew governance\r\n\r\nðŸ“š **[Browse all examples â†’](./examples/)**\r\n\r\n## The AgentMesh Proxy: \"SSL for AI Agents\"\r\n\r\n**Problem:** AI agents like Claude Desktop have unfettered access to your filesystem, database, and APIs through MCP servers. One hallucination could be catastrophic.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** AgentMesh acts as a transparent governance proxy:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Before: Unsafe direct access\r\n{\r\n  \"mcpServers\": {\r\n    \"filesystem\": {\r\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\r\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/Users/me\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# After: Protected by AgentMesh\r\n{\r\n  \"mcpServers\": {\r\n    \"filesystem\": {\r\n      \"command\": \"agentmesh\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"proxy\", \"--policy\", \"strict\",\r\n        \"--target\", \"npx\", \"--target\", \"-y\",\r\n        \"--target\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\",\r\n        \"--target\", \"/Users/me\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What you get:**\r\n- ðŸ”’ **Policy Enforcement** - Block dangerous operations before they execute\r\n- ðŸ“Š **Trust Scoring** - Behavioral monitoring (800-1000 scale)  \r\n- ðŸ“ **Audit Logs** - Tamper-evident record of every action\r\n- âœ… **Verification Footers** - Visual confirmation in outputs\r\n\r\n**Set it up in 10 seconds:**\r\n```bash\r\nagentmesh init-integration --claude\r\n# Restart Claude Desktop - done!\r\n```\r\n\r\nLearn more: **[Claude Desktop Integration Guide](./docs/integrations/claude-desktop.md)**\r\n\r\n## Core Concepts\r\n\r\n### 1. Agent Identity\r\n\r\nEvery agent gets a unique, cryptographically bound identity:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom agentmesh import AgentIdentity\r\n\r\nidentity = AgentIdentity.create(\r\n    name=\"data-analyst-agent\",\r\n    sponsor=\"alice@company.com\",  # Human accountability\r\n    capabilities=[\"read:data\", \"write:reports\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Delegation Chains\r\n\r\nAgents can delegate to sub-agents, but scope **always narrows**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Parent agent delegates to child\r\nchild_identity = parent_identity.delegate(\r\n    name=\"summarizer-subagent\",\r\n    capabilities=[\"read:data\"],  # Subset of parent's capabilities\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Trust Handshakes (IATP)\r\n\r\nCross-agent communication requires trust verification:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom agentmesh import TrustBridge\r\n\r\nbridge = TrustBridge()\r\n\r\n# Verify peer before communication\r\nverification = await bridge.verify_peer(\r\n    peer_id=\"did:mesh:other-agent\",\r\n    required_trust_score=700,\r\n)\r\n\r\nif verification.verified:\r\n    await bridge.send_message(peer_id, message)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Reward Scoring\r\n\r\nEvery action is scored across multiple dimensions:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom agentmesh import RewardEngine\r\n\r\nengine = RewardEngine()\r\n\r\n# Actions are automatically scored\r\nscore = engine.get_agent_score(\"did:mesh:my-agent\")\r\n# {\r\n#   \"total\": 847,\r\n#   \"dimensions\": {\r\n#     \"policy_compliance\": 95,\r\n#     \"resource_efficiency\": 82,\r\n#     \"output_quality\": 88,\r\n#     \"security_posture\": 91,\r\n#     \"collaboration_health\": 84\r\n#   }\r\n# }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5. Policy Engine\r\n\r\nDeclarative governance policies:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# policy.yaml\r\nversion: \"1.0\"\r\nagent: \"data-analyst-agent\"\r\n\r\nrules:\r\n  - name: \"no-pii-export\"\r\n    condition: \"action.type == 'export' and data.contains_pii\"\r\n    action: \"deny\"\r\n    \r\n  - name: \"rate-limit-api\"\r\n    condition: \"action.type == 'api_call'\"\r\n    limit: \"100/hour\"\r\n    \r\n  - name: \"require-approval-for-delete\"\r\n    condition: \"action.type == 'delete'\"\r\n    action: \"require_approval\"\r\n    approvers: [\"security-team\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Protocol Support\r\n\r\n| Protocol | Status | Description |\r\n|----------|--------|-------------|\r\n| A2A | âœ… Alpha | Agent-to-agent coordination |\r\n| MCP | âœ… Alpha | Tool and resource binding |\r\n| IATP | âœ… Alpha | Trust handshakes (via agent-os) |\r\n| ACP | ðŸ”„ Beta | Lightweight messaging |\r\n| SPIFFE | âœ… Alpha | Workload identity |\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n```\r\nagentmesh/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ identity/           # Layer 1: Identity & Zero-Trust\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agent_id.py     # Agent identity management\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ credentials.py  # Ephemeral credential issuance\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ delegation.py   # Delegation chains\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ spiffe.py       # SPIFFE/SVID integration\r\nâ”‚\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ trust/              # Layer 2: Trust & Protocol Bridge\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bridge.py       # Protocol bridge\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handshake.py    # Trust handshakes\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ capability.py   # Capability scoping\r\nâ”‚\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ protocols/          # Protocol implementations\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ a2a/            # A2A support\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp/            # MCP support\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ iatp/           # IATP (uses agent-os)\r\nâ”‚\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ governance/         # Layer 3: Governance & Compliance\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ policy.py       # Policy engine\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ compliance.py   # Compliance mapping\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ audit.py        # Merkle-chained audit logs\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ shadow.py       # Shadow mode\r\nâ”‚\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ reward/             # Layer 4: Reward & Learning\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ engine.py       # Reward engine\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scoring.py      # Multi-dimensional scoring\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ learning.py     # Adaptive learning\r\nâ”‚\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ cli/                # Command-line interface\r\nâ””â”€â”€ sdk/                # Python SDK\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Compliance\r\n\r\nAgentMesh automates compliance mapping for:\r\n\r\n- **EU AI Act** â€” Risk classification, transparency requirements\r\n- **SOC 2** â€” Security, availability, processing integrity\r\n- **HIPAA** â€” PHI handling, audit controls\r\n- **GDPR** â€” Data processing, consent, right to explanation\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom agentmesh import ComplianceEngine\r\n\r\ncompliance = ComplianceEngine(frameworks=[\"soc2\", \"hipaa\"])\r\n\r\n# Generate compliance report\r\nreport = compliance.generate_report(\r\n    agent_id=\"did:mesh:healthcare-agent\",\r\n    period=\"2026-01\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Threat Model\r\n\r\n| Threat | AgentMesh Defense |\r\n|--------|-------------------|\r\n| Prompt Injection | Tool output sanitized at Protocol Bridge |\r\n| Credential Theft | 15-min TTL, instant revocation on trust breach |\r\n| Shadow Agents | Unregistered agents blocked at network layer |\r\n| Delegation Escalation | Chains are cryptographically narrowing |\r\n| Cascade Failure | Per-agent trust scoring isolates blast radius |\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n| Phase | Timeline | Deliverables |\r\n|-------|----------|--------------|\r\n| Alpha | Q1 2026 | Identity Core, A2A+MCP bridge, CLI |\r\n| Beta | Q2 2026 | IATP handshake, Reward Engine v1, Dashboard |\r\n| GA | Q3 2026 | Compliance automation, Enterprise features |\r\n| Scale | Q4 2026 | Agent Marketplace, Partner integrations |\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nAgentMesh builds on:\r\n\r\n- **[agent-os](https://github.com/imran-siddique/agent-os)** â€” IATP protocol, Nexus trust exchange\r\n- **SPIFFE/SPIRE** â€” Workload identity\r\n- **OpenTelemetry** â€” Observability\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nApache 2.0 â€” See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Agents shouldn't be islands.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Instead of relying on prompts to enforce safety (\"please don't do dangerous things\"), it provides application-level middleware that intercepts and validates agent actions before execution.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** This is application-level enforcement (Python middleware), not OS kernel-level isolation. Agents run in the same process. For true isolation, run agents in containers.\r\n\r\n```\r\nâ”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”\r\nâ”‚              USER SPACE (Agent Code)                    â”‚\r\nâ”‚   Your agent code runs here.

The LLM decides whether to comply.\r\n\r\n**Kernel-based safety** intercepts actions before execution. The policy engine decides, not the LLM.\r\n\r\nThis is the same principle operating systems use: applications request resources, the kernel grants or denies access based on permissions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph TB\r\n    subgraph \"Layer 4: Execution\"\r\n        SCAK[Self-Correcting Agent Kernel]\r\n        MUTE[Mute Agent]\r\n        ATR[Agent Tool Registry]\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    subgraph \"Layer 3: Control Plane\"\r\n        KERNEL[ðŸŽ¯ THE KERNEL<br/>Policy Engine + Signals]\r\n        OBS[Observability<br/>Prometheus + OTEL]\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    subgraph \"Layer 2: Communication\"\r\n        AMB[Agent Message Bus]\r\n        IATP[Inter-Agent Trust Protocol]\r\n        CMVK[Cross-Model Verification]\r\n        EMK[Episodic Memory Kernel]\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    subgraph \"Layer 1: Primitives\"\r\n        PRIM[Base Types + Failures]\r\n        CAAS[Context-as-a-Service]\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    SCAK --> KERNEL\r\n    MUTE --> KERNEL\r\n    ATR --> KERNEL\r\n    KERNEL --> AMB\r\n    KERNEL --> IATP\r\n    KERNEL --> OBS\r\n    AMB --> PRIM\r\n    IATP --> CMVK\r\n    CMVK --> EMK\r\n    EMK --> PRIM\r\n    CAAS --> PRIM\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Directory Structure\r\n\r\n```\r\nagent-os/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ src/agent_os/             # Core Python package\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py           # Public API\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cli.py                # Command-line interface\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ integrations/         # Framework adapters\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ modules/                  # Kernel Modules (4-layer architecture)\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ primitives/           # Layer 1: Base types and failures\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cmvk/                 # Layer 1: Cross-model verification\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ emk/                  # Layer 1: Episodic memory kernel\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ caas/                 # Layer 1: Context-as-a-Service\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ amb/                  # Layer 2: Agent message bus\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ iatp/                 # Layer 2: Inter-agent trust protocol\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atr/                  # Layer 2: Agent tool registry\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ observability/        # Layer 2: Prometheus + OpenTelemetry\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ control-plane/        # Layer 3: THE KERNEL (policies, signals)\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scak/                 # Layer 4: Self-correcting agent kernel\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mute-agent/           # Layer 4: Face/Hands architecture\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ mcp-kernel-server/    # Integration: MCP protocol support\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ extensions/               # IDE & AI Assistant Extensions\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp-server/           # â­ MCP Server (Copilot, Claude, Cursor)\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vscode/               # VS Code extension\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ copilot/              # GitHub Copilot (DEPRECATED -

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Each upstream project remains separate under `repos/` with its own build, release cadence, and license.\\n\\n## What Is Included\\n\\n- `RESEARCH_OVERVIEW.md` - comparative analysis, architecture mapping, research questions\\n- `REPO_STATS.md` - snapshot metadata (commit, status, license, stack)\\n- `repos/FailSafe` - VS Code governance extension (TypeScript/Node.js)\\n- `repos/agent-mesh` - cloud-native trust layer for agent ecosystems (Python)\\n- `repos/agent-os` - kernel-style governance for autonomous agents (Python)\\n\\n## Why These Three Repos\\n\\nAll three projects reject prompt-based safety in favor of deterministic enforcement:\\n\\n- FailSafe evaluates actions at the editor boundary using intent gating, audits, and a ledgered trail.\\n- AgentMesh enforces trust at the protocol layer with identity, delegation, compliance, and reward scoring.\\n- Agent OS intercepts actions at runtime with a policy engine, signals, and kernel-like primitives.\\n\\nTogether they form a full-stack governance model:\\n\\n| Layer | Focus | Upstream Project |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Developer Experience | Save-time governance, audits, dashboards | FailSafe |\\n| Coordination & Trust | Identity, protocol bridge, compliance, rewards | AgentMesh |\\n| Runtime & Policies | Action interception, signals, VFS, audit | Agent OS |\\n\\n## Snapshot (2026-02-05)\\n\\n| Repo | Status | License | Language |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| FailSafe | Beta v2.0.1 | MIT | TypeScript/Node.js |\\n| AgentMesh | Alpha (Q1 2026) | Apache 2.0 | Python 3.11+ |\\n| Agent OS | Research (core production-ready, extensions experimental) | MIT | Python 3.10+ |\\n\\n## Research Starting Points\\n\\n1. Read the comparative overview: `RESEARCH_OVERVIEW.md`\\n2. Review the snapshot metadata: `REPO_STATS.md`\\n3. Dive into each upstream README:\\n   - `repos/FailSafe/README.md`\\n   - `repos/agent-mesh/README.md`\\n   - `repos/agent-os/README.md`\\n\\n## Core Concepts to Track\\n\\n- Deterministic enforcement over prompt compliance\\n- Trust, verification, and delegation (IATP, CMVK, QoreLogic)\\n- Audit trails and compliance mapping (ledger vs Merkle logs vs flight recorder)\\n- MCP integration patterns across IDE, proxy, and kernel server\\n\\n## Research Hypotheses (Not Implemented Here)\\n\\nThese are synthesis ideas drawn from the upstream docs and are not implemented in this workspace:\\n\\n- FailSafe could consume AgentMesh trust signals for editor-time governance.\\n- AgentMesh could coordinate governed agents running on Agent OS kernels.\\n- A shared policy language could unify the three enforcement layers.\\n\\n## Working With Each Repo\\n\\nEach upstream project has its own build and install steps. Follow the instructions in their README files. This workspace does not provide a unified build or release pipeline.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nThis workspace is for comparative research. For code changes, follow each upstream project’s contribution guidelines:\\n\\n- `repos/FailSafe/CONTRIBUTING.md`\\n- `repos/agent-mesh/CONTRIBUTING.md`\\n- `repos/agent-os/CONTRIBUTING.md`\\n\\n## Licenses and Attribution\\n\\nEach upstream repository retains its original license and authorship.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each upstream project remains separate under `repos/` with its own build, release cadence, and license.\r\n\r\n## What Is Included\r\n\r\n- `RESEARCH_OVERVIEW.md` - comparative analysis, architecture mapping, research questions\r\n- `REPO_STATS.md` - snapshot metadata (commit, status, license, stack)\r\n- `repos/FailSafe` - VS Code governance extension (TypeScript/Node.js)\r\n- `repos/agent-mesh` - cloud-native trust layer for agent ecosystems (Python)\r\n- `repos/agent-os` - kernel-style governance for autonomous agents (Python)\r\n\r\n## Why These Three Repos\r\n\r\nAll three projects reject prompt-based safety in favor of deterministic enforcement:\r\n\r\n- FailSafe evaluates actions at the editor boundary using intent gating, audits, and a ledgered trail.\r\n- AgentMesh enforces trust at the protocol layer with identity, delegation, compliance, and reward scoring.\r\n- Agent OS intercepts actions at runtime with a policy engine, signals, and kernel-like primitives.\r\n\r\nTogether they form a full-stack governance model:\r\n\r\n| Layer | Focus | Upstream Project |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Developer Experience | Save-time governance, audits, dashboards | FailSafe |\r\n| Coordination & Trust | Identity, protocol bridge, compliance, rewards | AgentMesh |\r\n| Runtime & Policies | Action interception, signals, VFS, audit | Agent OS |\r\n\r\n## Snapshot (2026-02-05)\r\n\r\n| Repo | Status | License | Language |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| FailSafe | Beta v2.0.1 | MIT | TypeScript/Node.js |\r\n| AgentMesh | Alpha (Q1 2026) | Apache 2.0 | Python 3.11+ |\r\n| Agent OS | Research (core production-ready, extensions experimental) | MIT | Python 3.10+ |\r\n\r\n## Research Starting Points\r\n\r\n1. Read the comparative overview: `RESEARCH_OVERVIEW.md`\r\n2. Review the snapshot metadata: `REPO_STATS.md`\r\n3. Dive into each upstream README:\r\n   - `repos/FailSafe/README.md`\r\n   - `repos/agent-mesh/README.md`\r\n   - `repos/agent-os/README.md`\r\n\r\n## Core Concepts to Track\r\n\r\n- Deterministic enforcement over prompt compliance\r\n- Trust, verification, and delegation (IATP, CMVK, QoreLogic)\r\n- Audit trails and compliance mapping (ledger vs Merkle logs vs flight recorder)\r\n- MCP integration patterns across IDE, proxy, and kernel server\r\n\r\n## Research Hypotheses (Not Implemented Here)\r\n\r\nThese are synthesis ideas drawn from the upstream docs and are not implemented in this workspace:\r\n\r\n- FailSafe could consume AgentMesh trust signals for editor-time governance.\r\n- AgentMesh could coordinate governed agents running on Agent OS kernels.\r\n- A shared policy language could unify the three enforcement layers.\r\n\r\n## Working With Each Repo\r\n\r\nEach upstream project has its own build and install steps. Follow the instructions in their README files. This workspace does not provide a unified build or release pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThis workspace is for comparative research. For code changes, follow each upstream project's contribution guidelines:\r\n\r\n- `repos/FailSafe/CONTRIBUTING.md`\r\n- `repos/agent-mesh/CONTRIBUTING.md`\r\n- `repos/agent-os/CONTRIBUTING.md`\r\n\r\n## Licenses and Attribution\r\n\r\nEach upstream repository retains its original license and authorship. See their `LICENSE` files for terms.\r\n\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations. Experimental skills live in https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.experimental and can be installed the same way.\r\n\r\nUse the helper scripts based on the task:\r\n- List skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do. Default listing is `.curated`, but you can pass `--path skills/.experimental` when they ask about experimental skills.\r\n- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.\r\n- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).\r\n\r\nInstall skills with the helper scripts.\r\n\r\n## Communication\r\n\r\nWhen listing skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request. If they ask about experimental skills, list from `.experimental` instead of `.curated` and label the source accordingly:\r\n\"\"\"\r\nSkills from {repo}:\r\n1. skill-1\r\n2. skill-2 (already installed)\r\n3. ...\r\nWhich ones would you like installed?\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nAfter installing a skill, tell the user: \"Restart Codex to pick up new skills.\"\r\n\r\n## Scripts\r\n\r\nAll of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.\r\n\r\n- `scripts/list-skills.py` (prints skills list with installed annotations)\r\n- `scripts/list-skills.py --format json`\r\n- Example (experimental list): `scripts/list-skills.py --path skills/.experimental`\r\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`\r\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`\r\n- Example (experimental skill): `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo openai/skills --path skills/.experimental/<skill-name>`\r\n\r\n## Behavior and Options\r\n\r\n- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.\r\n- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.\r\n- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.\r\n- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).\r\n- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.\r\n- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API.

If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.\r\n- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.\r\n\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\r\nmetadata:\r\n  short-description: Create or update a skill\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Skill Creator\r\n\r\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\r\n\r\n## About Skills\r\n\r\nSkills are modular, self-contained folders that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\r\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\r\ndomains or tasksâ€”they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\r\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\r\n\r\n### What Skills Provide\r\n\r\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\r\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\r\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\r\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\r\n\r\n## Core Principles\r\n\r\n### Concise is Key\r\n\r\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\r\n\r\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\r\n\r\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\r\n\r\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\r\n\r\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\r\n\r\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\r\n\r\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\r\n\r\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\r\n\r\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\r\n\r\n### Anatomy of a Skill\r\n\r\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\r\n\r\n```\r\nskill-name/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md (required)\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\r\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ name: (required)\r\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ description: (required)\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Markdown instructions (required)\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ agents/ (recommended)\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ openai.yaml - UI metadata for skill lists and chips\r\nâ””â”€â”€ Bundled Resources (optional)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\r\n    â””â”€â”€ assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### SKILL.md (required)\r\n\r\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\r\n\r\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\r\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\r\n\r\n#### Agents metadata (recommended)\r\n\r\n- UI-facing metadata for skill lists and chips\r\n- Read references/openai_yaml.md before generating values and follow its descriptions and constraints\r\n- Create: human-facing `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill\r\n- Generate deterministically by passing the values as `--interface key=value` to `scripts/generate_openai_yaml.py` or `scripts/init_skill.py`\r\n- On updates: validate `agents/openai.yaml` still matches SKILL.md; regenerate if stale\r\n- Only include other optional interface fields (icons, brand color) if explicitly provided\r\n- See references/openai_yaml.md for field definitions and examples\r\n\r\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\r\n\r\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\r\n\r\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\r\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\r\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\r\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\r\n\r\n##### References (`references/`)\r\n\r\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\r\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\r\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\r\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\r\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\r\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skillâ€”this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\r\n\r\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\r\n\r\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\r\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\r\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\r\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\r\n\r\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\r\n\r\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\r\n\r\n- README.md\r\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\r\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\r\n- CHANGELOG.md\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\r\n\r\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\r\n\r\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\r\n\r\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\r\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\r\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\r\n\r\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\r\n\r\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\r\n\r\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# PDF Processing\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\r\n[code example]\r\n\r\n## Advanced features\r\n\r\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\r\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\r\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\r\n\r\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbigquery-skill/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\r\nâ””â”€â”€ reference/\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ product.md (API usage, features)\r\n    â””â”€â”€ marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncloud-deploy/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\r\nâ””â”€â”€ references/\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\r\n    â””â”€â”€ azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\r\n\r\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# DOCX Processing\r\n\r\n## Creating documents\r\n\r\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\r\n\r\n## Editing documents\r\n\r\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\r\n\r\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\r\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\r\n\r\n**Important guidelines:**\r\n\r\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\r\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\r\n\r\n## Skill Creation Process\r\n\r\nSkill creation involves these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\r\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\r\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\r\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\r\n5. Validate the skill (run quick_validate.py)\r\n6. Iterate based on real usage\r\n\r\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\r\n\r\n### Skill Naming\r\n\r\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\r\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\r\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\r\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\r\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\r\n\r\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\r\n\r\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\r\n\r\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\r\n\r\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\r\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\r\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\r\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\r\n\r\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\r\n\r\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\r\n\r\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\r\n\r\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\r\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\r\n\r\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\r\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\r\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\r\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\r\n\r\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\r\n\r\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists. In this case, continue to the next step.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\r\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\r\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script:\r\n\r\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\r\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\r\n- Creates `agents/openai.yaml` using agent-generated `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` passed via `--interface key=value`\r\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\r\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\r\n\r\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\r\n\r\nGenerate `display_name`, `short_description`, and `default_prompt` by reading the skill, then pass them as `--interface key=value` to `init_skill.py` or regenerate with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/generate_openai_yaml.py <path/to/skill-folder> --interface key=value\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly include other optional interface fields when the user explicitly provides them. For full field descriptions and examples, see references/openai_yaml.md.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\r\n\r\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\r\n\r\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\r\n\r\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\r\n\r\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\r\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\r\n\r\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\r\n\r\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\r\n\r\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\r\n\r\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\r\n\r\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\r\n\r\n#### Update SKILL.md\r\n\r\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\r\n\r\n##### Frontmatter\r\n\r\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\r\n\r\n- `name`: The skill name\r\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\r\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\r\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\r\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\r\n\r\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\r\n\r\n##### Body\r\n\r\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Validate the Skill\r\n\r\nOnce development of the skill is complete, validate the skill folder to catch basic issues early:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe validation script checks YAML frontmatter format, required fields, and naming rules. If validation fails, fix the reported issues and run the command again.\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Iterate\r\n\r\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\r\n\r\n**Iteration workflow:**\r\n\r\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\r\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\r\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\r\n4. Implement changes and test again\r\n\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Common patterns:\r\n\r\n**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)\r\n- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures\r\n- Example: DOCX skill with \"Workflow Decision Tree\" -> \"Reading\" -> \"Creating\" -> \"Editing\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Workflow Decision Tree -> ## Step 1 -> ## Step 2...\r\n\r\n**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)\r\n- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities\r\n- Example: PDF skill with \"Quick Start\" -> \"Merge PDFs\" -> \"Split PDFs\" -> \"Extract Text\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Quick Start -> ## Task Category 1 -> ## Task Category 2...\r\n\r\n**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\r\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\r\n- Example: Brand styling with \"Brand Guidelines\" -> \"Colors\" -> \"Typography\" -> \"Features\"\r\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Guidelines -> ## Specifications -> ## Usage...\r\n\r\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\r\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\r\n- Example: Product Management with \"Core Capabilities\" -> numbered capability list\r\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Core Capabilities -> ### 1. Feature -> ### 2. Feature...\r\n\r\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

All three projects explicitly **reject prompt-based safety** in favor of deterministic, policy-driven enforcementã€34â€ L18-L21ã€‘. In other words, none of them simply ask an LLM to â€œbe safeâ€ and trust its response. Instead, they enforce rules at specific layers:\n\n- **FailSafe** (MythologIQ/FailSafe) is a **VSÂ Code extension and governance framework** for AI coding assistantsã€2â€ L29-L34ã€‘. It applies **â€œsave-timeâ€ (editor boundary) checks** on user actions using an *Intent Service* and policies (â€œQoreLogicâ€), plus fileâ€watcher audits (â€œSentinelâ€) and an appendâ€‘only ledgerã€34â€ L18-L21ã€‘ã€19â€ L16-L24ã€‘. It is **local-first**, controlling code edits before they are saved (kernel-style safety at the IDE)ã€6â€ L65-L74ã€‘.  \n- **AgentMesh** (imran-siddique/agent-mesh) is a **cloud-native trust layer** for multi-agent systemsã€3â€ L74-L83ã€‘ã€9â€ L19-L28ã€‘. It spans agent coordination, identity, and incentives. AgentMesh provides a **zero-trust identity fabric** (agent CA issuing SPIFFE/SVID certificates with short TTLs and human sponsor bindings) and a **protocol bridge** (A2A, MCP, IATP)ã€41â€ L38-L41ã€‘ã€32â€ L7-L15ã€‘. On top of that, it runs a **policy/compliance plane** (e.g. EUÂ AIÂ Act, SOC2 rules, Merkle audit logs) and a **reward/learning engine** (continuous trust scoring, behavioral incentives)ã€41â€ L29-L39ã€‘ã€9â€ L25-L33ã€‘. In essence, AgentMesh answers â€œWho are you and can you trust each other?â€ in a multi-agent cloud, enforcing it with cryptography, handshakes, and scoring.  \n- **AgentÂ OS** (imran-siddique/agent-os) is an **â€œoperating systemâ€ for AI agents**ã€11â€ L2-L4ã€‘. It provides a runtime â€œkernelâ€ that **intercepts every agent action** (API call, tool invocation, etc.) against deterministic policiesã€44â€ L104-L109ã€‘. Its layers mirror an OS: **LayerÂ 1 primitives** (types, failures, context services), **LayerÂ 2 communication** (message bus, inter-agent trust protocol (IATP), cross-model verification), **LayerÂ 3 control plane** (the kernel with policy engine, signals, virtual file system), and **LayerÂ 4 execution** (self-healing agents, tool registry)ã€44â€ L139-L148ã€‘. AgentÂ OS emphasizes in-process isolation: policies are enforced by middleware (not relying on the LLM to self-regulate)ã€44â€ L104-L109ã€‘. \n\nA comparative breakdown makes this explicit:\n\n| **Aspect**      | **FailSafe (Aegis IDE)**           | **AgentMesh (Trust Layer)**                 | **AgentÂ OS (Kernel)**                     |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| **Target**      | VSÂ Code/Cursor IDE (developer)   | Cloud/Multi-agent network                  | Agent runtime / any AI process            |\n| **Scope**       | Editor save-time / repo changes   | Multi-agent orchestration & protocol bridge | In-process, per-agent kernel enforcement |\n| **Enforcement** | Intent-gating, file audits        | Protocol-level checks, policy engine, rewards| Action interception via policy engine    |\n| **Identity**    | *(none built-in â€“ human user)*    | Agent identities via CA + SPIFFE (15m TTL)ã€41â€ L38-L41ã€‘ | POSIX-like process IDs (wrapped in IATP)|\n| **Trust**       | QoreLogic trust engine            | IATP handshakes + continuous trust scoresã€41â€ L29-L39ã€‘ | IATP protocol & *CMVK* consensus          |\n| **Policy**      | JSON/YAML â€œrisk gradingâ€ rulesã€16â€ L42-L51ã€‘ | Declarative compliance policies (EUÂ AI Act, etc.)ã€41â€ L53-L61ã€‘| Structured policy engine with templatesã€44â€ L139-L148ã€‘|\n| **Audit**       | Append-only â€œSOAâ€ ledger          | Merkle-tree audit logs                    | SQLite Flight Recorder (append-only log)  |\n| **MCP Support** | Outbound MCP proxy (tool calls audit)ã€6â€ L82-L90ã€‘ | MCP **proxy**: â€œSSL for AIâ€ (all agent-tool calls go through policy)ã€41â€ L143-L152ã€‘ | MCP kernel server for Claude/Copilot/â€‹Cursorã€4â€ L184-L187ã€‘ |\n\nã€34â€ L18-L21ã€‘ã€31â€ L259-L268ã€‘\n\nFrom the above, several themes emerge:\n\n- **Deterministic Governance:** All layers enforce rules algorithmically, not via trust in an LLMâ€™s â€œwillâ€ã€34â€ L18-L21ã€‘. FailSafe intercepts saves, AgentMesh intercepts inter-agent calls, and AgentÂ OS intercepts internal actions. This guarantees repeatable, auditable outcomes.\n- **Trust and Identity:** AgentMesh brings a mature identity scheme (certificates, SPIFFE IDs, sponsor accountability)ã€41â€ L38-L41ã€‘. AgentÂ OS leverages the same IATP handshake (since it integrates with AgentMesh)ã€32â€ L25-L33ã€‘. FailSafe today assumes the human is implicitly â€œtrustedâ€ (no separate agent ID). To unify, one strategy is to extend AgentMeshâ€™s ID system down to the IDE level (e.g. issue a certificate to the user or the VSÂ Code session).\n- **Policy Unification:** Each has its own policy concepts (FailSafeâ€™s risk triggers, Meshâ€™s compliance rules, OSâ€™s kernel policies). A key integration idea is a **common policy language or meta-model**. For example, using a policy-as-code engine (like OPA/Rego or a custom DSL) could allow rules to be written once and applied by all three layers. Alternately, a translation layer could map domain-specific rules into each subsystemâ€™s formatã€34â€ L49-L52ã€‘.\n- **Audit and Logging:** Each maintains tamper-evident logs (ledger, Merkle, flight recorder). These could be unified into a **single audit trail** (e.g. a shared Merkle-chained ledger) or cross-linked by cryptographic hashes. For instance, AgentÂ OSâ€™s actions could log into FailSafeâ€™s ledger or AgentMeshâ€™s logs, ensuring a holistic provenance. \n\n## Tiered Execution Model (L1/L2/L3)\n\nOne powerful organizing principle is **tiered escalation**: use the minimal layer necessary to handle a task safely, and escalate only if needed. We can formalize three tiers:\n\n- **L1 â€“ Local Single-Agent (Fast Path):** A simple task (e.g. lint fix, small refactor) is handled by **FailSafe alone** on the developerâ€™s machine. Complexity and cost are minimal. Formally, let $C_1$ be the cost (in tokens or time) for one agent to handle the task under FailSafe checks (intent gating, quick policy check). Since no inter-agent comms or extra infrastructure is used, $C_1 \\approx T_\\text{exec} + T_\\text{qorelogic}$, typically very low. Trust is implicitly high (the userâ€™s own system), so no overhead. \n\n- **L2 â€“ Local Multi-Agent (Team Co-Op):** More complex work (e.g. coordinated refactoring, multi-module change, or multi-step plan) can use **AgentÂ OS and/or FailSafe coordination** locally. Here we might spin up *n* agents (e.g. specialized Claude/GPT agents) using the AgentÂ OS kernel as a local orchestrator (or Claude Teams). The cost scales roughly linearly: \n  \\[\n    C_2 \\approx n \\cdot C_1 + O_\\text{coord}\\,,\n  \\]\n  where $n$ is the number of agents and $O_\\text{coord}$ is orchestration overhead. We assume a single trust domain (same machine/user), so we skip heavy trust handshakes. FailSafe/QoreLogic can still audit the final output. If $C_2$ remains moderate, no need to involve AgentMesh. This covers most day-to-day developer workflows.\n\n- **L3 â€“ Distributed / High-Risk (Mesh-Enabled):** Tasks needing cross-system coordination, high assurance, or compliance (e.g. deploying to prod, handling secrets, multi-team systems) use the full mesh. Here **AgentMesh** comes into play: we might have agents on different machines or cloud, communicate via IATP, enforce organization policies (HIPAA, EUÂ AIÂ Act, etc.), and incorporate human approvals (via AgentMeshâ€™s delegate/sponsor model and FailSafeâ€™s L3 queue). Costs now include network and crypto: \n  \\[\n    C_3 \\approx C_2 + O_\\text{net} + O_\\text{crypto} + O_\\text{audit},\n  \\]\n  with additional overhead for credential checks and logging. We can introduce a **risk score** $R$ or **trust threshold** $T$. For example, define \n  \\[\n    R = w_s S + w_c C + w_t (1-T), \n  \\]\n  where $S$ = scope (e.g. lines of code, modules affected), $C$ = sensitivity (contains â€œDROPÂ TABLEâ€, creds, etc.), $T$ = existing trust score of agents, and $w_i$ are weights. If $R > \\theta$ (a policy threshold), escalate to L3. Conversely, if trust $T$ (initially from AgentMeshâ€™s score [0â€“1000]) falls below a limit, require multi-agent verification (e.g. through AgentÂ OSâ€™s CMVK consensus or human-in-loop). \n\n**Qualitative and Quantitative Impacts:** Multi-agent modes dramatically improve quality at the expense of cost. Studies show multi-agent orchestration can achieve near-100% goal success (vs single-digit for solo LLM)ã€27â€ L96-L104ã€‘, but costs multiple LLM queries. We capture this trade-off mathematically by **cost vs. reliability** curves. E.g. if one agent has uncertainty $\\epsilon$, $n$ independent agents using consensus reduce failure probability roughly as $\\epsilon^n$. Meanwhile, cost roughly triples for $n=3$. Thus, $n$ is chosen so that reliability meets SLA while cost remains acceptable.  \n\n**Trust and Score Models:** AgentMeshâ€™s reward engine scores agents on an 800â€“1000 scaleã€41â€ L176-L184ã€‘. We can model each agentâ€™s trust $T_i$ as a Bayesian belief: each action updates $P(\\text{honest} \\mid \\text{action})$. Delegation chains (splitting tasks) cause trust to multiply or shrink. A simple model: if agent $A$ delegates to $B$, trust$(B) = \\text{trust}(A) \\times \\rho$, with $\\rho <1$ to reflect reduced scope. The **global trust threshold** might enforce that only agents with $T_i > 900$ can operate without oversight; others require human confirmation (FailSafe L3 approval). This can be formalized with probability theory (e.g. Beta distributions updating on each positive/negative outcome) to quantify confidence.\n\n## Integration Strategies & API Contracts\n\nTo marry these systems, we propose **modular interfaces** and a phased integration plan:\n\n- **Unify Identity/Trust:** Adopt AgentMeshâ€™s PKI (agent CA, SPIFFE) across all layers. For instance, assign each FailSafe session or IDE-extension user a SPIFFE identity (could be a derivative of the userâ€™s account). Extend the IATP protocol library from AgentÂ OS/AgentMesh into FailSafe so that any â€œtool callâ€ from the IDE can be signed and verified. **API idea:** define an `IdentityManager` interface with methods like `issueAgentCertificate(name, sponsor) â†’ Cert`, `verifySignature(message, cert)`, `revoke(cert)`, etc. All components (IDE, Mesh services, kernel) implement this API. Use mutual TLS under the hood. This creates a single trust root for the merged system.\n\n- **Common Policy Engine:** Build or adopt a **Policy-as-Code** platform (e.g. Open Policy Agent, or a custom engine) that can express both event-driven rules and static compliance. Define a **Policy Schema** (e.g. Rego modules or JSON/YAML) that covers use-cases: e.g. â€œBlock `DROP TABLE`,â€ â€œLimit API calls per minute,â€ â€œRequire 2FA for credential writes,â€ etc. **API idea:** a `PolicyEngine` interface with `evaluate(action, context) â†’ allow/deny`, and subscription to policy updates. FailSafeâ€™s QoreLogic and AgentÂ OS kernel call the same evaluator; AgentMeshâ€™s governance plane also uses it for network calls. Over time, rules can be tagged by scope: IDE-level, mesh-level, OS-level, but sourced from a unified policy repository.\n\n- **Orchestration Abstraction:** Decide on an **Orchestration Provider Interface**. One model: Let FailSafe remain the **default orchestrator for local dev flows** (spawning local AgentÂ OS threads or LLMs), and let AgentMesh orchestrate only when distributed trust is needed. We define an `Orchestrator` API (in pseudo-TypeScript/Python) with methods like `spawnAgents(task, count)`, `routeMessage(srcAgent, destAgent, message)`, `coordinateMultiStep(tasks)`, etc. Under L1/L2, this interface is implemented by a simple Node/Thread runner (FailSafe/Claude Teams). Under L3, it is implemented by the AgentMesh service (which can launch cross-machine jobs, handle IATP, etc.). This makes the escalation explicit: code just invokes `orchestrator.launch(...)`, and the system chooses FailSafe-runner vs Mesh-runner based on the tier.  \n\n- **Audit Log Schema:** Define a shared ledger format. Each audit entry should include fields like `{ timestamp, agent_id (SPIFFE), action, resource, result, parent_hash }`. We can adopt a Merkle-chained SQLite schema (from AgentÂ OS) or any append-only log, but ensure compatibility. **API idea:** an `AuditLog` interface with `append(entry)`, `verifyIntegrity()`, `query(filters)`. FailSafeâ€™s SOA ledger and AgentÂ OS flight recorder would both write to this structure. A unified dashboard (like Genesis) could then display audits from all layers in one stream.\n\n- **Shared Data Models:** Agree on schemas for **Intents**, **Tasks**, **Delegation Chains**, **Policies**, etc. For example, an â€œIntentâ€ object (FailSafe concept) might be representable as a policy with time-scoped privileges. Map these to AgentMeshâ€™s delegation constructs by signing the intent and broadcasting via IATP if needed. Also, use common schema for **capabilities** and **roles** (e.g. as SPIFFE selectors or tokens) so that AgentMeshâ€™s capability scoping can govern AgentÂ OSâ€™s primitives.\n\n## Quantitative Modeling of Costs and Thresholds\n\nWe can sketch simple models to guide thresholds:\n\n- **Cost Model:** Let $n$ = number of agents, $m$ = number of messages. For an L2 scenario, \n  \\[\n     C_2 \\approx n\\,c_\\text{LLM} + m\\,c_\\text{msg} + c_\\text{overhead},\n  \\]\n  where $c_\\text{LLM}$ is cost per LLM call (tokens Ã— price) and $c_\\text{msg}$ is inter-agent communication cost (negligible if local). For L3, add network latency and cryptographic overhead:\n  \\[\n     C_3 \\approx C_2 + c_\\text{crypto}(m) + c_\\text{net}(d),\n  \\]\n  where $c_\\text{crypto}(m)\\approx m \\cdot \\log(N_\\text{certs})$ (signature verification cost) and $c_\\text{net}(d)\\approx d\\times$latency (distance). These can be measured empirically. For example, if one L1 operation costs \\$0.05 (few tokens), a 3-agent L2 might be \\$0.20, whereas an L3 across cloud might be \\$0.50â€“\\$1.00 due to orchestrator overhead and logging. We use such estimates to set business rules: e.g. tasks estimated to cost >\\$0.3 (in compute/tokens) or to touch >10 files automatically trigger L3 review.  \n\n- **Trust/Threshold Model:** Define each agentâ€™s trust score $T_i\\in[0,1000]$ (as in AgentMesh). Let $T_{\\min}$ be the minimum for unsupervised action. We can set $T_{\\min}=900$ (per AgentMeshâ€™s scale) for full autonomy. If a proposed action is sensitive (per a heuristic) and $T_i < T_{\\min}$, require an L3 approval. Over time, trust decays (e.g. $T_i \\leftarrow \\alpha T_i$ for some $0.9<\\alpha<1$ per risky action). Mathematically, $T_i$ can be modeled with a Beta distribution update: success raises $T$ slightly, failures drop it, and if $T_i$ falls below a critical percentile, escalation is mandated. Similarly, one can define a **task risk score** $R \\in [0,1]$ as a normalized weighted sum of factors (file count, keyword flags, environment variables accessed). Then policies can be expressed as $R > \\tau \\implies$ â€œinvoke AgentMesh orchestrator and require dual approvals.â€ These thresholds ($T_{\\min}, \\tau$) can be tuned offline.\n\n## Integration Roadmap\n\nFinally, we propose a phased migration/merge plan for the repositories and codebases:\n\n1. **PhaseÂ 1 â€“ Repository Consolidation (Monorepo Assembly):** Create a single repository (e.g. â€œAegis-Coreâ€) containing the three codebases as subprojects (`failsafe/`, `agent-mesh/`, `agent-os/`). Standardize the build system (e.g. use a monorepo build with npm for TS and pip for Python) and set up cross-language CI. Import shared libraries (crypto, logging). Ensure each subproject builds in place. This enables joint development and tracking of cross-cutting issues.  \n\n2. **PhaseÂ 2 â€“ Identity Layer Unification:** Implement the `IdentityManager` API. Refactor FailSafe to initialize an AgentMesh CA client (or embed lightweight cert generation) so that every â€œuserâ€ or VSÂ Code session has a cert. AgentÂ OS already uses SPIFFE certificates for IATPã€41â€ L38-L41ã€‘; connect this to AgentMeshâ€™s CA backend. Update all components to authenticate each other via TLS using these certs. Migrate existing key storage to a unified keystore. Now, for example, the FailSafe Intent Service could sign each Intent with its sessionâ€™s key, and AgentMesh trust policies can verify these signatures on actions.\n\n3. **PhaseÂ 3 â€“ Policy Integration:** Define a global policy schema or DSL. Migrate FailSafeâ€™s JSON risk rules and AgentMeshâ€™s compliance templates into this format. Plug in a single engine (e.g. Rego) as `PolicyEngine`. Replace each systemâ€™s native check with calls to this engine. For example, FailSafeâ€™s â€œrisk graderâ€ becomes a Rego rule set; AgentÂ OSâ€™s signal handlers call the same engine. Ensure that granular flags (heuristic audit vs block) are unified. Maintain per-layer overrides: e.g. AgentÂ OS may have additional context (kernel events) in policy inputs, while AgentMesh includes network message context. Begin writing **integration tests**: one policy that covers all layers (e.g. â€œdeny external file write unless signed by high-trust agentâ€) and verify it blocks appropriately in IDE, mesh proxy, and kernel.\n\n4. **PhaseÂ 4 â€“ Audit Log Convergence:** Develop the `AuditLog` interface and a shared backing store. We can start by having each system log to its own storage, then write a â€œlog-bridgeâ€ service that pulls records and builds a unified Merkle log. In final form, they should either log to the same database or append to the same Git-tracked ledger files. Equip all components with the same log schema (timestamps in UTC, standardized event types). Implement automated verifiers: e.g. a nightly job that confirms the Merkle root covers all sub-logs. This ensures a tamper-evident chain spanning IDE events through to runtime actions. \n\n5. **PhaseÂ 5 â€“ Orchestration Routing:** Wire up the `Orchestrator` interface. Initially, keep FailSafe as the default: it can instantiate AgentÂ OS kernels or spawn python threads for local tasks. Implement a â€œMesh Gatewayâ€ in FailSafe: if a task is flagged L3, forward it to AgentMesh by calling `agentmesh run` or via an API. Vice versa, allow AgentMesh to invoke FailSafeâ€™s CLI (e.g. to open a VSÂ Code review). The system logic for tiering (L1 vs L2 vs L3) can be a configuration in Aegis. As confidence grows, you might invert control: treat AgentMesh as master orchestrator that â€œcalls backâ€ to FailSafe for developer UI flows, keeping a single schedule of tasks.\n\n6. **PhaseÂ 6 â€“ Deprecation and Cleanup:** Once integration is stable, deprecate duplicate functionality. For example, if AgentMesh now handles all identity, remove any leftover token logic in FailSafe. Consolidate documentation, rename modules as needed (e.g. the monorepo might be named â€œaegis-governanceâ€ with components under `faulsafe/`, `mesh/`, `os/`). Publish unified versioning: for any release, tag all subprojects (or each separately but note compatibility). Provide migration guides for users (e.g. â€œOpen your VSÂ Code project in Aegis mode: it will now register with AgentMeshâ€™s CA automaticallyâ€).\n\nThroughout, **proof-of-concept examples** are vital. For instance, build a sample workflow: â€œDeveloper invokes `/ql-plan` in VSÂ Code (FailSafe). The plan spawns two AgentÂ OS agents (running under the hood) to generate code. They sign results and send to AgentMesh for trust scoring. If trust passes, the code is auto-committed; if not, it lands in the L3 queue for human approval.â€ Each arrow in that flow corresponds to an interface we design. We would unit-test each piece: identity issuance, policy check, audit log entry, trust score update, etc. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy treating FailSafe, AgentMesh, and AgentÂ OS as **layers of a single governance stack**, we create a complete safety net: from IDE to cloud to runtime. The key is **separation of concerns** with well-defined contracts:\n\n- **FailSafe** stays at the userâ€™s side for immediate developer feedback.  \n- **AgentMesh** becomes the network fabric of identity and high-level coordination.  \n- **AgentÂ OS** is the embedded guardian inside each agent process.  \n\nWhere they overlap, we pick one owner (e.g. AgentMesh for identity, FailSafe for intent definitions). Integration then â€œelevatesâ€ the whole. For example, an action blocked by AgentÂ OS will be recorded in the shared ledger and trigger a notification in the FailSafe dashboard. A new agent spawned by AgentMesh will inherit policies from the unified policy engine. \n\nThis **harmonious stack** leverages each projectâ€™s strengths. AgentMeshâ€™s trust protocols keep the multi-agent cluster honest; AgentÂ OSâ€™s kernel ensures even seemingly minor actions are checked; and FailSafeâ€™s developer tools turn opaque AI behavior into visible, controllable processes. By math, the system maximizes *safety/determinism per cost*: L1 for cheap speed, L3 only when high trust or compliance is needed. \n\nAll proposed interfaces and algorithms (Trust models, cost formulas, policy DSLs) are fully implementable. The references above provide the building blocksã€34â€ L18-L21ã€‘ã€41â€ L38-L41ã€‘ã€44â€ L104-L109ã€‘. Our integration planâ€”guided by these concrete primitivesâ€”lays out an actionable path to **Aegis: a unified governance platform**. By progressively merging code and defining clear APIs, we ensure no detail is overlooked: every policy, log, and identity is accounted for. The result is a system ready for rigorous testing and eventual production: an **Aegis Guardian** that stays on the rails through every phase of AI automation.\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The core move is to unify them through shared interfaces for identity, policy evaluation, orchestration, and audit logs, while preserving their distinct enforcement boundaries. Evidence: `G:\\MythologIQ\\Aegis\\deep-research-report.md`.  \n\n2. **Security/Trust Lens**  \nIt emphasizes deterministic enforcement over prompt compliance, with trust based on identity, short‑lived credentials, and signed actions. The proposed escalation model (L1/L2/L3) ties risk and trust thresholds to when the mesh is invoked, and suggests unifying audit logs to create tamper‑evident provenance across layers. Evidence: `G:\\MythologIQ\\Aegis\\deep-research-report.md`.  \n\n3. **Compliance Lens**  \nCompliance mapping is framed as a policy‑as‑code problem: one policy schema or engine that each layer consumes, so EU AI Act/SOC2/HIPAA‑style checks become consistent across IDE, mesh, and kernel. This avoids divergent rule sets and enables a single compliance narrative.

The core move is to unify them through shared interfaces for identity, policy evaluation, orchestration, and audit logs, while preserving their distinct enforcement boundaries. Evidence: `G:\\MythologIQ\\Aegis\\deep-research-report.md`.  \n\n2. **Security/Trust Lens**  \nIt emphasizes deterministic enforcement over prompt compliance, with trust based on identity, short‑lived credentials, and signed actions. The proposed escalation model (L1/L2/L3) ties risk and trust thresholds to when the mesh is invoked, and suggests unifying audit logs to create tamper‑evident provenance across layers. Evidence: `G:\\MythologIQ\\Aegis\\deep-research-report.md`.  \n\n3. **Compliance Lens**  \nCompliance mapping is framed as a policy‑as‑code problem: one policy schema or engine that each layer consumes, so EU AI Act/SOC2/HIPAA‑style checks become consistent across IDE, mesh, and kernel. This avoids divergent rule sets and enables a single compliance narrative. Evidence: `G:\\MythologIQ\\Aegis\\deep-research-report.md`.  \n\n4. **Developer Experience Lens**  \nThe tiered model keeps local workflows fast (FailSafe + local Agent OS) and only escalates to AgentMesh for high‑risk or distributed tasks.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
