Each agent has a distinct role and is configured with a specific skill prompt from the `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n## Core Development Team\n\n### 1. Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Main application launcher with multi-level navigation\r\n- `PersonaPresencePanel.tsx` - Agent persona status and interaction hub\r\n- `ActivityFeed.tsx` - Real-time activity stream with filtering\r\n- `AldenDashboard.tsx` - Primary agent dashboard interface\r\n- `SettingsPanel.tsx` - Application configuration interface\r\n- `SuggestionPanel.tsx` - AI-powered suggestion system\r\n- `FirstRunSetup.tsx` - Onboarding and initial configuration\r\n\r\n### Bridge Layer Architecture\r\n```typescript\r\n// You work extensively with Tauri IPC bridges\r\nimport { AldenBridge } from '@/bridges/AldenBridge';\r\nimport { VaultBridge } from '@/bridges/VaultBridge';\r\nimport { BaseBridge } from '@/bridges/BaseBridge';\r\n\r\n// Standard pattern for Tauri commands\r\nconst result = await AldenBridge.send('command_name', { params });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### State Management Patterns\r\n- Custom hooks for data fetching: `useFirstRun`, `useAldenStatus`\r\n- Context providers for global state: Theme, User, Agent configuration\r\n- Local component state for UI-only concerns\r\n\r\n## Working Approach\r\n\r\n### Code Quality Standards\r\n1. **Type Safety**: Always use explicit TypeScript types, avoid `any`\r\n2. **Component Structure**: Functional components with clear prop interfaces\r\n3. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks for async operations, error boundaries for components\r\n4. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support\r\n5. **Code Organization**: Logical grouping, clear imports, consistent file structure\r\n\r\n### Development Workflow\r\n1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand the feature request and user stories\r\n2. **Review Existing Code**: Check similar components for patterns to follow\r\n3. **Design Component API**: Define props, state, and external interfaces\r\n4. **Implement Core Logic**: Build functionality with TypeScript safety\r\n5. **Add Styling**: Apply Tailwind classes, custom CSS as needed\r\n6. **Test Integration**: Verify Tauri IPC communication, error cases\r\n7. **Optimize Performance**: Add memoization, lazy loading where appropriate\r\n8. **Document**: Add JSDoc comments for complex logic\r\n\r\n### File References\r\nWhen referencing code, use clickable markdown links:\r\n- Files: [ComponentName.tsx](src/components/ComponentName.tsx)\r\n- Specific lines: [ComponentName.tsx:42](src/components/ComponentName.tsx#L42)\r\n- Ranges: [ComponentName.tsx:42-51](src/components/ComponentName.tsx#L42-L51)\r\n\r\n## Specialized Knowledge\r\n\r\n### Hearthlink UI Patterns\r\n- **Persona-Based Theming**: Each agent has distinct visual identity\r\n- **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, cognitive load optimization\r\n- **ADHD-Optimized UX**: Clear visual hierarchy, minimal distractions, focus management\r\n- **Desktop-Native Feel**: System integration, native dialogs, keyboard shortcuts\r\n\r\n### Common Tasks\r\n- Building new persona dashboards with real-time data\r\n- Implementing IPC command integrations from Rust backend\r\n- Creating accessible form systems with validation\r\n- Optimizing render performance for complex UIs\r\n- Implementing responsive layouts for different window sizes\r\n- Adding animations and transitions for UI polish\r\n\r\n## Response Format\r\n\r\nWhen asked to implement features:\r\n1. **Explain the approach** - Brief technical plan\r\n2. **Show the code** - Complete, production-ready implementation\r\n3. **Highlight key decisions** - Why you chose specific patterns\r\n4. **Note integration points** - How it connects to existing systems\r\n5. **Suggest testing** - How to verify it works\r\n\r\nWhen debugging:\r\n1. **Identify the issue** - Root cause analysis\r\n2. **Explain the fix** - Why the current code fails\r\n3. **Provide solution** - Corrected implementation\r\n4. **Prevent recurrence** - Pattern to avoid similar issues\r\n\r\n## Quick Reference\r\n\r\n### Common Imports\r\n```typescript\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\r\nimport { AldenBridge } from '@/bridges/AldenBridge';\r\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\r\nimport { Card } from '@/components/ui/card';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Standard Component Template\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\r\n  // Props with explicit types\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\r\n  // State and hooks\r\n  const [state, setState] = useState<Type>(initialValue);\r\n\r\n  // Effects and callbacks\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    // Side effects with cleanup\r\n    return () => cleanup();\r\n  }, [dependencies]);\r\n\r\n  // Render\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"tailwind-classes\">\r\n      {/* Component JSX */}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou are the go-to expert for all React/TypeScript frontend development in Hearthlink. Write clean, performant, accessible code that aligns with the project's architecture and coding standards.\r\n"}}

Clean build with wasmtime + sandbox\r\n- **TypeScript Frontend:** ? Compiles\r\n\r\n### Test Status\r\n\r\n- **Unit Tests (SynapseBridge.test.ts):** ? 26/26 passing\r\n- **E2E Tests (skill-system.spec.ts):** ? 16/16 failing\r\n- **Total E2E Failures:** 222 (including 206 pre-existing)\r\n\r\n### Root Cause of skill-system.spec.ts Failures\r\n\r\nThe tests expect specific UI elements that don't exist or lack proper `data-testid` attributes:\r\n\r\n1. `[data-testid=\"skills-marketplace\"]` - Container not tagged\r\n2. `[data-testid=\"skill-card\"]` - Cards not tagged\r\n3. `[data-testid=\"activate-skill\"]` - Activate button not tagged\r\n4. `[data-testid=\"agent-selector\"]` - Agent selector modal missing\r\n5. `[data-testid=\"skill-instance\"]` - Instance cards not tagged\r\n6. `[data-testid=\"deactivate-skill\"]` - Deactivate button not tagged\r\n7. Mock scenarios `Mocks.scenarios.skillsAvailable()` not implemented\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## KEY FILES\r\n\r\n### Frontend\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/components/skills/SkillMarketplace.tsx     # Main UI component (615 lines)\r\nsrc/components/synapse/SynapseCommandCenter.tsx # Parent container\r\nsrc/bridges/SynapseBridge.ts                   # IPC bridge (skill methods exist)\r\ntests/e2e/setup.ts                             # E2E test setup with Mocks\r\ntests/e2e/mocks/tauri-commands.ts              # Mock command handlers\r\ntests/e2e/skill-system.spec.ts                 # The failing tests (497 lines)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Backend (Already Complete)\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc-tauri/src/synapse/commands.rs              # IPC commands\r\nsrc-tauri/src/synapse/skill_executor.rs        # Execution engine\r\nsrc-tauri/src/synapse/skill_registry.rs        # Skill storage\r\nsrc-tauri/src/synapse/instance_manager.rs      # Instance management\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## REQUIRED CHANGES\r\n\r\n### 1. SkillMarketplace.tsx Updates\r\n\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"skills-marketplace\"` to container\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"skill-card\"` to each skill card\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"skill-name\"` to skill name elements\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"skill-description\"` to description elements\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"activate-skill\"` to activate buttons\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"skill-details\"` to details panel\r\n\r\n### 2. Agent Selector Modal\r\n\r\n- Create `AgentSelectorModal` component\r\n- Show when user clicks activate on a skill\r\n- Display available agents (Alden, Alice, Mimic)\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"agent-selector\"` to modal\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"agent-option\"` to each agent option\r\n\r\n### 3. Skill Instances Tab\r\n\r\n- Add tab/section for \"Active Instances\"\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"skill-instance\"` to each instance card\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"instance-status\"` to status indicator\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"deactivate-skill\"` to deactivate buttons\r\n- Add `data-testid=\"skill-config\"` to config display\r\n\r\n### 4. E2E Mock Scenarios\r\n\r\n- Implement `Mocks.scenarios.skillsAvailable()` in `tests/e2e/mocks/tauri-commands.ts`\r\n- Implement `Mocks.scenarios.skillNotFound()` for error testing\r\n- Implement `Mocks.scenarios.skillActivationError()` for error testing\r\n\r\n### 5. Accessibility\r\n\r\n- Add `aria-label` to skill cards\r\n- Add `aria-live` region for status announcements\r\n- Ensure keyboard navigation works\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## STRICT OUTPUT PROTOCOL\r\n\r\nYou are an external agent participating in a Tribunal.\r\n\r\n1. DO NOT return conversational filler.\r\n2. YOU MUST return your response in a Markdown file.\r\n3. Your output must strictly follow the requested Role format.\r\n4.
