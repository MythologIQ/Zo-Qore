You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

access can be limited to current month or previous months based on subscription.\r\n- By default, endpoints return the latest data; historical changes are accessed via groupBy=timestamp.\r\n- When grouped by timestamp, each entry includes a timestamp property; filtering by timestamp is only allowed when groupBy=timestamp is included (otherwise an error occurs).\r\n- Example usage: /api/v1/device/_search?industry=Manufacturing&groupBy=industry&groupBy=timestamp&calculate=avgRisk\r\n- Filtering supports operators: [eq], [gt], [ge], [like], [lt], [le], [overlap], [ne], [nlike].\r\n- Operator support varies by type: Text (ne, eq, like, nlike), Number (ne, eq, ge, lt, gt, le), Enum (eq, ne), Date (eq, ge, lt, gt, le), Array (overlap).\r\n- Syntax: ?field=value or ?field[operator]=value; text filtering is case-insensitive.\r\n- You can repeat the same field parameter multiple times to OR values.\r\n- Ordering: default order is by calculated fields (e.g., share, avgRisk) descending.\r\n- orderBy syntax: ?orderBy=field, ?orderBy=field:asc, ?orderBy=field:desc.\r\n- You can order by any calculation or any field present in the result; multiple fields can be comma-separated.\r\n- Grouping: default grouping is by all entity fields; override with groupBy.\r\n- groupBy syntax: ?groupBy=field; to group by multiple fields, repeat groupBy.\r\n- groupBy supports any field or calculation supported by the entity.\r\n- Pagination: default returns first 10 entries; response includes items, count, total, next, prev fields.\r\n- Query params: from (start index) and length (number of entries); max length is 1000.\r\n- Search CVE endpoint: GET https://ic.armis.com/api/v1/cve/_search.\r\n- Query params include pagination (from, length) plus filters for id, description, severity, score, published, matchStatus, earlyWarning, weaponized, hasRansomware, cisaDueDate, numberOfReferences, numberOfThreatActors, threatActors[overlap], device.* fields, and threat.* fields.\r\n- Responses documented: 200 OK, 400 Schema Error.\r\n- Search device endpoint: GET https://ic.armis.com/api/v1/device/_search.\r\n- Query params include pagination (from, length), groupBy/calculate/orderBy, timestamp filters, and device attributes (industry, group, category, type, brand, model, osName, osVersion, osTitle) plus nested cve.* and threat.* filters (including ids, descriptions, severity/score/published, matchStatus, earlyWarning, weaponized, hasRansomware, cisaDueDate, numberOfReferences, numberOfThreatActors, and threatActors[overlap]).\r\n- Search threat endpoint: GET https://ic.armis.com/api/v1/threat/_search.\r\n- Query params include pagination (from, length), groupBy/calculate/orderBy, timestamp filters, threat attributes (type, host, direction), cve.* filters (including ids, descriptions, severity/score/published, matchStatus, earlyWarning, weaponized, hasRansomware, cisaDueDate, numberOfReferences, numberOfThreatActors, threatActors[overlap]), and device.* filters (industry, group, category, type, brand, model, osName, osVersion, osTitle).\r\n- Responses documented: 200 OK, 400 Schema Error.\r\n\r\n## Unverified notes (from secondary summaries in provided files)\r\nThese items appear in SecurityVendorAPIData.md but are not backed by official Armis content in this repo:\r\n- OAuth2 client credentials token endpoint and payload fields (audience, vendor_id, scopes).\r\n- API base URL https://api.armis.com/v3/ and endpoint /v3/assets/_search.\r\n- Scope names such as PERMISSION.DEVICE.READ.\r\n- Token lifetime and tenant-specific audience requirement.\r\n\r\n## Missing minimum requirements (to finalize integration)\r\n- Confirmed token endpoint, required payload fields, and scope model for API v3.\r\n- Confirmed base URL and required headers for assets and risk queries.\r\n- Tenant-specific guidance for audience/tenant URL usage.\r\n\r\n## Next actions\r\n- Provide the content (or static exports) of the official Armis auth and API reference pages listed above.\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

According to CrowdStrike’s documentation, the base domain for API requests depends on your cloud: For example, use api.crowdstrike.com for the US-1 (Commercial) cloud, api.us-2.crowdstrike.com for US-2, api.eu-1.crowdstrike.com for EU-1, and api.laggar.gcw.crowdstrike.com for the US-GOV-1 (GovCloud) environment\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:47:. CrowdStrike’s own documentation and swagger UI URLs follow this pattern as well (the OpenAPI specs are hosted on region-specific domains)\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:48:. Auth Flow & Token Endpoint: CrowdStrike APIs use an OAuth2 Client Credentials flow. You must first create an API client (Client ID and Secret) in the Falcon UI (under Support > API Clients and Keys) and assign it the required permissions\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:52:. You must include this token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header for subsequent API calls. (When the token expires, your integration should request a new one using the same endpoint and credentials.) Required Scopes/Permissions: When creating the API client in the Falcon UI, you will choose which API scopes (permissions) to grant. CrowdStrike has a granular permission model where each functional area (like Hosts, Detections, Incidents, Sensor Download, etc.) has its own read/write scopes. To successfully pull the data you need, be sure to enable the relevant scopes for your API client. For example, to read device (host) information, include the Hosts Read scope; to fetch detections or incidents, include the Detects Read and/or Incident Read scopes\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:54:. Each API client’s scopes can be fine-tuned to least privilege. The key point is that the API will only return data permitted by the scopes – e.g., an API call to get detection details will fail if the client lacks the “Detections: Read” permission. CrowdStrike’s official documentation (accessible via the Falcon UI) provides a table of scopes for each API endpoint category, and third-party guides (e.g. from Red Canary or others) list exactly which scopes are needed for specific use cases\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:57:, and CrowdStrike’s developer documentation (Falcon API guide and official add-on docs)\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:153:Microsoft Word - CrowdStrike Falcon Device Technical Add-On Guide v2.1 - update.docx\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:155:https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CrowdStrike-Falcon-Device-Technical-Add-On-Guide.pdf\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:157:How to connect to the CrowdStrike API | Tines\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:161:How to connect to the CrowdStrike API | Tines\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:169:For CrowdStrike spoke , Unable to get token throwing the error ...\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:173:Microsoft Word - CrowdStrike Falcon Device Technical Add-On Guide v2.1 - update.docx\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:175:https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CrowdStrike-Falcon-Device-Technical-Add-On-Guide.pdf\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:177:Microsoft Word - CrowdStrike Falcon Device Technical Add-On Guide v2.1 - update.docx\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:179:https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CrowdStrike-Falcon-Device-Technical-Add-On-Guide.pdf\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:181:Create API Credentials to Integrate Your Existing CrowdStrike ...\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData2.md:185:CrowdStrike\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:20:CrowdStrike: Falcon API base URL for your cloud region + OAuth2 token flow\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:32:CrowdStrike cloud region (e.g., US-1, US-2, EU).\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:137:CrowdStrike (Falcon API – Regional Base URLs & OAuth2)\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:138:CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform APIs are available on multiple cloud regions.

(The KnowBe4 guide above notes “All other regions” use the default api.crowdstrike.com, which typically refers to the US-1 cloud\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:145:OAuth2 Authentication: CrowdStrike APIs use OAuth2 Client Credentials for authentication. In the Falcon UI, you must create an API client (with a set of API scopes/permissions like read access to Hosts, Alerts, etc.). This will provide you a Client ID and Client Secret. To get an access token, you call the OAuth token endpoint in your cloud: POST https://api.<your-region>.crowdstrike.com/oauth2/token \r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:147:. The token is a Bearer token and must be included in subsequent API calls: Authorization: Bearer <token>. Once you have the token, you can call the various Falcon APIs. CrowdStrike’s APIs are segmented by product area (for example, Hosts, Device Control Policies, Incidents, etc.), typically under /devices/, /policy/, /detects/, etc., on the same base host. The documentation (on CrowdStrike’s Developer Portal) for each endpoint details the URL and parameters. For instance, to list devices (hosts) you might call GET /devices/queries/devices-scroll/v1 (along with some params for filtering or pagination), and to get device details: GET /devices/entities/devices/v1?ids=<device_id>. All such calls are made to the same domain (api.<region>.crowdstrike.com) and require the Authorization header. Note on Scopes: When creating the API client in Falcon, you select the permissions (scopes) it has – e.g., read Hosts, read Incidents, etc. The token issued will be limited to those scopes. If you try to call an API that your client isn’t permissioned for, you’ll get a 403 error. So ensure you grant the client the scopes needed for the data you intend to pull (the KnowBe4 example above enabled “Read” on Alerts for their integration\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:149:. Your integration should be built to request a new token after expiry. CrowdStrike’s best practice is not to request a new token for every API call, but rather reuse the token until it expires, then obtain a fresh one. The API will return HTTP 401 Unauthorized if a token is expired or invalid, at which point you should re-authenticate. There is also a token revocation endpoint (/oauth2/revoke), which you might use if you need to programmatically revoke a token, but generally it’s not needed for most integrations (tokens expire quickly anyway). Rate Limits: CrowdStrike’s API rate limits vary by method and your license. Typically, the rate limits are generous (e.g., Combined 50 requests per minute for many GET endpoints, and lower for POST/DELETE operations), but certain bulk endpoints have specific limits. CrowdStrike will return HTTP 429 if you exceed limits. It’s wise to consult the CrowdStrike API documentation for your specific endpoints to see any stated limits. The FalconPy SDK or community references (like the GitHub issue notes) sometimes mention that if you are on a non-US1 cloud, you must specify the base URL in their SDK config (which matches what we described)\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData.md:150:.

For example: US-1: https://api.crowdstrike.com, US-2: https://api.us-2.crowdstrike.com, EU-1: https://api.eu-1.crowdstrike.com, and US-GOV-1: https://api.laggar.gcw.crowdstrike.com . Use the base URL that corresponds to the cloud where your Falcon instance is hosted (the CrowdStrike UI will show which cloud your tenant is on).\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData3.md:31:OAuth2 Token Endpoint: CrowdStrike uses OAuth2 for API authentication via client ID/secret. The token endpoint is at the same regional domain with the path /oauth2/token. For example, a US-1 customer would obtain tokens from https://api.crowdstrike.com/oauth2/token  (EU-1 would use api.eu-1.crowdstrike.com/oauth2/token, etc.). You POST your client credentials to this endpoint to get an access token, which is then used as a Bearer token for API calls.\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\SecurityVendorAPIData3.md:34:Required API Scopes: When you create the API client in the Falcon console, you must grant it the necessary permissions (scopes) for the data you plan to access. CrowdStrike scopes are set per API family. For example, to fetch device information you would enable the “Hosts” scope with at least “Read” access. Ensure the API client has all required read scopes (e.g. Hosts Read, Alerts Read, Event Streams Read, etc., as needed) before using its credentials – otherwise the API calls for missing scopes will be denied. Each API client’s Base URL and scope selections can be reviewed in the Falcon UI when generating the keys.\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\vendor_api\\README.md:13:- CrowdStrike: vendor_api/CROWDSTRIKE_API_NOTES.md\r\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\vendor_api\\CROWDSTRIKE_API_NOTES.md:1:# CrowdStrike - API Integration Notes (Provided Sources Only)\nG:\\MythologIQ\\Hearthlink\\docs\\04_security_privacy\\vendor_api\\CROWDSTRIKE_API_NOTES.md:4:This document is compiled only from materials provided in-repo or pasted by the user.

Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink.

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
