Mock Implementation\r\nAdd the following mock handlers to `tests/e2e/mocks/tauri-commands.ts`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Mock for alice_biometric_status\r\ncase 'alice_biometric_status':\r\n  return {\r\n    connected: false,\r\n    source: 'simulation',\r\n    last_reading: {\r\n      heart_rate: 72,\r\n      hrv: 45,\r\n      timestamp: Date.now()\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n// Mock for alice_biometric_connect\r\ncase 'alice_biometric_connect':\r\n  return { success: true, source: 'simulation' };\r\n\r\n// Mock for alice_biometric_disconnect\r\ncase 'alice_biometric_disconnect':\r\n  return { success: true };\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. E2E Test Scaffold\r\nCreate `tests/e2e/biometric-simulation.spec.ts`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { test, expect, Mocks, Helpers } from './setup';\r\n\r\ntest.describe('Alice Biometric Integration - (Simulation Mode)', () => {\r\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\r\n    await Mocks.install(page);\r\n    // Disable onboarding\r\n    await page.addInitScript(() => {\r\n      window.localStorage.setItem('hearthlink_onboarding_completed', 'true');\r\n    });\r\n    await page.goto('/alice');\r\n    await Helpers.waitForAppReady(page);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  test('should display biometric status card', async ({ page }) => {\r\n    const statusCard = page.locator('[data-testid=\"biometric-status-card\"]');\r\n    await expect(statusCard).toBeVisible();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  test('should show \"Simulated\" label when using mock data', async ({ page }) => {\r\n    const sourceLabel = page.locator('[data-testid=\"biometric-source\"]');\r\n    await expect(sourceLabel).toContainText('Simulation');\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  test('should display heart rate in valid range (50-180)', async ({ page }) => {\r\n    const hrDisplay = page.locator('[data-testid=\"heart-rate-display\"]');\r\n    const text = await hrDisplay.textContent();\r\n    const hr = parseInt(text?.replace(/\\D/g, '') || '0', 10);\r\n    expect(hr).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(50);\r\n    expect(hr).toBeLessThanOrEqual(180);\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## CODE QUALITY RULES (QORELOGIC)\r\n\r\n1. **< 250 Lines Total.** This is a focused verification task.\r\n2. **No New External Dependencies.** Use existing Playwright setup.\r\n3. **Follow Existing Conventions.** Match the style of `drift-detection.spec.ts`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## OUTPUT PROTOCOL\r\n\r\nYou MUST generate a completion report at:\r\n**`.agent/staging/responses/AGENT_1_CODEX_VERIFICATION.md`**\r\n\r\nThe report MUST include:\r\n1.  **Header:** `# REPORT: AGENT 1 (CODEX_VERIFICATION)`\r\n2.  **Summary:** What tests did you write?\r\n3.  **Code:** The full `biometric-simulation.spec.ts` and the additions to `tauri-commands.ts`.\r\n4.  **Status:** `[COMPLETE / PARTIAL / FAILED]`\r\n\r\n**FAILURE TO WRITE THIS FILE WILL RESULT IN YOUR WORK BEING DISCARDED.**\r\n","images":[]}}

Each change must note the\r\n   owning agent in commit summaries/PR descriptions and reflect that agent's\r\n   responsibilities.\r\n2. **Pair with QAOR** – every code or documentation change requires an explicit\r\n   verification note (tests run, manual checks, or follow-up tasks) so the QA\r\n   agent can trace coverage.  Capture skipped tests with rationale.\r\n3. **Trace to issues** – align work with the validated backlog\r\n   (`docs/planning/issues/issue-validation.md`).  Reference the relevant issue\r\n   number(s) in commits/PRs and ensure acceptance criteria remain satisfied.\r\n4. **Record learnings** – if work surfaces new risks or debt, update the risk\r\n   register (`docs/planning/risk-register.md`) or advanced backlog as part of\r\n   the same change.\r\n5. **Maintain artefacts** – update orchestration docs under\r\n   `docs/planning/codex-sprint/` whenever responsibilities, sequencing, or QA\r\n   expectations shift.\r\n\r\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository unless a deeper\r\n`AGENTS.md` overrides them.\r\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Capture skipped tests with rationale.\r\n3. **Trace to issues** – align work with the validated backlog\r\n   (`docs/planning/issues/issue-validation.md`).  Reference the relevant issue\r\n   number(s) in commits/PRs and ensure acceptance criteria remain satisfied.\r\n4. **Record learnings** – if work surfaces new risks or debt, update the risk\r\n   register (`docs/planning/risk-register.md`) or advanced backlog as part of\r\n   the same change.\r\n5. **Maintain artefacts** – update orchestration docs under\r\n   `docs/planning/codex-sprint/` whenever responsibilities, sequencing, or QA\r\n   expectations shift.\r\n\r\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository unless a deeper\r\n`AGENTS.md` overrides them.\r\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each agent owns a portfolio of issues and collaborates through the\r\norchestration cadence documented in `execution-roadmap.md`. All agents report weekly to the sprint\r\nlead for dependency review and unblockers.\r\n\r\n## Agent roster\r\n\r\n| Agent | Specialisation | Primary Issues | Key Responsibilities |\r\n|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|\r\n| **Atlas (Platform Lead)** | Tauri shell, build systems, cross-platform delivery | 01, 06, 07, 08 | Maintain build pipelines, ensure UI integration tests, deliver signed installers. |\r\n| **Cipher (Security Lead)** | Vault, incident response, transport security | 04, 13, 14, 18 | Implement vault hardening, coordinate Synapse security, enforce incident drills, manage config audit trails. |\r\n| **Muse (Persona & Memory Architect)** | Persona registry, behavioural analytics, adaptive intelligence | 02, 03, 05, 11, 15, 16, 17 | Design persona APIs, voice orchestration, memory reconciliation, and adaptive ML guardrails. |\r\n| **Helios (Automation & Infrastructure)** | CI/CD, telemetry, release governance | 06, 08, 09, 10 | Expand integration testing, manage SBOM/scanning, maintain risk register and advanced backlog hygiene. |\r\n| **Nova (Workspace Experience)** | Workspace hub, oversight tooling, UI/UX | 07, 12 | Deliver oversight dashboards, accessibility/localisation improvements, user delight polish. |\r\n| **Scribe (Technical Communications)** | Knowledge base, troubleshooting guides, contributor education | Cross-cutting | Maintain comprehensive system documentation, module how-to articles, and the troubleshooting playbook; partner with agents to publish updates each sprint. |\r\n| **QAOR (Quality & Observability Reviewer)** | Validation, regression analysis, end-to-end assurance | All | Owns verification strategy, approves exit criteria, curates E2E test suites. |\r\n\r\n### QA Agent mandate\r\n\r\nThe **QAOR** agent operates independently from implementation agents. Responsibilities include:\r\n\r\n- Define acceptance and regression suites for every issue before development starts.\r\n- Witness key demos and sign off on Definition of Done compliance.\r\n- Maintain the consolidated test evidence archive in `docs/planning/codex-sprint/system-evaluation.md`.\r\n- File follow-up defects or improvement tasks into the risk register and advanced backlog.\r\n\r\n### Collaboration rules\r\n\r\n1. Every implementation agent pairs with QAOR during backlog refinement to translate adjustments from\r\n   `issue-validation.md` into executable test cases.\r\n2. Pull requests require at least one review from the owning agent and QAOR before merge.\r\n3. Status is tracked twice weekly in the orchestration stand-up; blockers escalate to the sprint lead\r\n   within 24 hours.\r\n4. Shared artefacts (schemas, API contracts) live under `docs/` with clear versioning to simplify QA\r\n   baselines and cross-agent collaboration.\r\n\r\n### External collaboration\r\n\r\nHelios curates [`external-contributions.md`](external-contributions.md) so third-party agents can\r\npick up well-scoped briefs without disrupting sprint flow. Lead agents must review and refresh their\r\nbriefs weekly, ensuring QAOR checkpoints remain accurate before external work begins.\r\n\r\n### Documentation stewardship\r\n\r\n**Scribe** partners with every agent to keep the knowledge base current:\r\n\r\n- Publish or update module reference guides and troubleshooting playbooks alongside each feature PR.\r\n- Coordinate with QAOR to capture validation evidence, reproducer steps, and known limitations.\r\n- Ensure `docs/planning/` artefacts reflect roster, sequencing, and risk updates before PR approval.\r\n"}}

Each subsection\r\nsummarises validation findings followed by actionable follow-ups.\r\n\r\n## Summary of key adjustments\r\n\r\n- Harden early-platform work (Issues 01, 04, 18) with explicit secure build, signing, and key-management\r\n  deliverables so later personas and intelligence work inherit a trustworthy foundation.\r\n- Clarify persona and voice pipelines (Issues 02, 03, 05) by adding regression harness requirements and\r\n  shared telemetry schemas to prevent divergent implementations across personas.\r\n- Expand testing expectations (Issues 06, 07, 12) to cover accessibility, localisation, and regression packs\r\n  spanning both the Tauri shell and the Python core.\r\n- Defer the most experimental intelligence initiatives (Issues 15ƒ?\"17) until the core workspace, security,\r\n  and observability stories are verifiably stable.\r\n\r\n## Detailed findings by issue\r\n\r\n### 01 ƒ?\" Scaffold Tauri + React app with CI\r\n- **Validation:** Scope establishes baseline shell but omits binary signing and SCA (supply chain analysis)\r\n  in CI. Without those gates, later releases could ship unsigned artifacts.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Add CI tasks for notarisation/signing where platform supports it and integrate a dependency\r\n  audit (e.g., `cargo audit`, `npm audit`, Snyk) into the workflow before packaging.\r\n\r\n### 02 ƒ?\" Persona registry and IPC\r\n- **Validation:** Registry schema defined but lacks backward-compatibility strategy and shared telemetry\r\n  format for persona events. IPC encryption mention needs explicit cipher/protocol selection.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Require versioned schema evolution docs, formalise persona event protobuf/JSON schema, and\r\n  specify use of the existing secure channel primitives from `docs/SECURITY_CONFIG.md` to avoid ad-hoc crypto.\r\n- **2025-02-16 Update:** Persona metadata registry landed (`src/personas/registry.py` with tests); lifecycle hooks and IPC bridge\r\n  remain outstanding and must document schema versioning before QAOR sign-off.\r\n- **2025-02-17 Update:** Lifecycle manager (`src/personas/lifecycle.py`) now wires shared context, audit trails, and default hooks for Alden/Alice/Mimic/Sentry; IPC bridge and dashboard work remain.\r\n- **2025-02-20 Update:** Versioned IPC envelopes and encryption metadata exported via `src/personas/ipc.py`; contract tests in\r\n  `tests/test_persona_ipc_envelope.py` reduce risk ahead of UI/dashboard delivery.\r\n\r\n### 03 ƒ?\" Local voice loop\r\n- **Validation:** Tasks cover packaging Whisper/Piper but ignore model update cadence and GPU/CPU feature\r\n  detection. Accessibility requirements for non-verbal cues and captions are missing.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Introduce a model lifecycle playbook (checksum verification, delta updates) and add tasks for\r\n  fallback UI indicators/subtitles plus energy-usage telemetry.\r\n- **2025-02-20 Update:** Voice loop orchestration (`src/voice/loop.py`) and hardware probe (`src/voice/hardware.py`) ship with\r\n  regression coverage (`tests/test_voice_loop.py`, `tests/test_voice_hardware.py`); Tauri control panel still pending.\r\n\r\n### 04 ƒ?\" Vault encryption, access control, audit logging\r\n- **Validation:** Strong coverage but lacks incident response hooks and backup/restore drills for vault data.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Add periodic disaster-recovery validation and tie audit logs into Sentry incident response\r\n  (Issue 14) with documented runbooks.\r\n\r\n### 05 ƒ?\" Memory system\r\n- **Validation:** Mentions retention policies yet omits data-classification tiers and reconciliation tooling when\r\n  personas desynchronise memories.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Require taxonomy-aligned tagging (per `appendix_g`) and build a memory reconciliation task to\r\n  surface divergence across personas with operator controls.\r\n- **2025-02-17 Update:** Memory repository (`src/core/memory/`) and context window budgeting shipped with Vault-backed\r\n  persistence and regression tests; remaining work covers dashboard UX, persona hooks, and reconciliation tooling.\r\n- **2025-02-18 Update:** Persona memory bridge now records lifecycle events and persona artefacts via\r\n  `src/personas/memory_bridge.py` with coverage in `tests/test_persona_memory_bridge.py`; outstanding items\r\n  include dashboard UX and reconciliation automation.\r\n- **2025-02-19 Update:** MemoryDashboardService (`src/core/memory/dashboard.py`) ships backend analytics with\r\n  coverage in `tests/test_memory_dashboard.py`, enabling Nova to focus on the dashboard UI implementation.\r\n- **2025-02-20 Update:** PersonaMemoryBridge publishes dashboard payload helpers with coverage in\r\n  `tests/test_persona_memory_dashboard.py`; Nova can now consume analytics without duplicating logic.\r\n\r\n### 06 ƒ?\" Integration & testing\r\n- **Validation:** Test plan focuses on persona orchestration but misses cross-platform UI regression suite and\r\n  load-testing around long-running sessions.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Add automated Tauri end-to-end snapshots (Playwright) and soak tests simulating multi-hour\r\n  sessions with memory churn to detect leaks.\r\n\r\n### 07 ƒ?\" UI/UX polish\r\n- **Validation:** Accessibility called out generally but not mapped to WCAG checkpoints or localisation.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Enumerate WCAG 2.2 AA objectives, include localisation scaffolding, and capture metrics for\r\n  neurodivergent-friendly interaction audits.\r\n\r\n### 08 ƒ?\" Build & release configuration\r\n- **Validation:** Focuses on multi-platform packaging but omits rollback strategy and artifact provenance.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Introduce release-candidate staging channel, SBOM generation, and documented rollback/resume\r\n  procedures aligned with CI sign-offs from Issue 01.\r\n\r\n### 09 ƒ?\" Risk register compilation\r\n- **Validation:** Adequately references governance but should embed review cadence and escalation triggers.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Add quarterly review checkpoints and align severity changes with Config/Feature flag governance\r\n  (Issue 18) to ensure mitigations feed into product toggles.\r\n\r\n### 10 ƒ?\" Advanced feature backlog\r\n- **Validation:** Captures ideation themes yet lacks prioritisation heuristics or lightweight sizing guidance.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Add value/effort scoring template and require linkage back to telemetry goals before promoting\r\n  backlog items into active work.\r\n\r\n### 11 ƒ?\" Alice behavioural analysis persona\r\n- **Validation:** Persona scope is ambitious but misses consent/review workflows for behavioural insights.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Require human-in-the-loop review toggles, journaling safeguards, and alignment with privacy\r\n  guidelines from Issue 18 before rollout.\r\n- **2025-02-20 Update:** Backend persona (`src/personas/alice.py`) delivers consent ledger, behavioural scoring, and memory\r\n  bridge integration; UI surfacing pending Nova.\r\n\r\n### 12 ƒ?\" Workspace hub and oversight controls\r\n- **Validation:** Solid coverage but oversight controls need threat detection integration and audit trails.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Mandate instrumentation hooks for Sentry/Synapse alerts and expand tasks to include admin-mode\r\n  session playback for compliance checks.\r\n\r\n### 13 ƒ?\" Synapse external communication security\r\n- **Validation:** Covers transport security; however, certificate rotation and anomaly detection are implicit.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Explicitly schedule rotation playbooks, integrate with Vault for credential storage, and add\r\n  behavioural analytics for outgoing webhooks.\r\n\r\n### 14 ƒ?\" Sentry security incident response\r\n- **Validation:** Response loop described yet missing drill cadence and SLA targets for acknowledgment/containment.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Add quarterly tabletop exercises and codify SLA metrics tied to risk register severities.\r\n\r\n### 15 ƒ?\" Mimic adaptive capabilities and dashboard\r\n- **Validation:** Enhancements rely on telemetry produced by prior issues but no guardrails exist for model drift.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Define drift detection, rollback triggers, and require dataset versioning with audit trails.\r\n- **2025-02-20 Update:** Adaptive engine/guardrails live in `src/personas/mimic_adaptive.py` with regression evidence via\r\n  `tests/test_mimic_adaptive.py`; dashboard UI remains outstanding.\r\n\r\n### 16 ƒ?\" Predictive intelligence and temporal analysis\r\n- **Validation:** Advanced analytics plan lacks privacy review and red-teaming, risking premature launch.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Introduce ethical review gates, differential privacy evaluation, and tie release to completion of\r\n  Issues 04, 05, 12, and 18.\r\n- **2025-02-20 Update:** Predictive intelligence prototype documented in\r\n  `docs/planning/codex-sprint/predictive-intelligence-blueprint.md` with implementation in `src/intelligence/predictive.py`;\r\n  workspace surfacing deferred.\r\n\r\n### 17 ƒ?\" Proactive assistance and contextual support\r\n- **Validation:** Suggestion engine lacks saturation controls for neurodivergent comfort levels and does not specify\r\n  conflict-resolution when multiple personas fire alerts simultaneously.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Add global throttling, persona arbitration policy, and pilot exit criteria before GA.\r\n\r\n### 18 ƒ?\" Configuration, preferences, and feature flags\r\n- **Validation:** Strong baseline but omit change management audit logs and remote support tooling to help users\r\n  recover from misconfiguration.\r\n- **Adjustment:** Require tamper-evident audit logging, support-mode overrides, and config snapshotting for rollback.\r\n- **2025-02-15 Update:** SettingsPanelService delivers the workspace settings data model and support runbook; Nova still owes front-end wiring and accessibility review before QAOR closes the gap.\r\n\r\n## Preferred execution order\r\n\r\nThe recommended sequencing balances foundation, risk reduction, and incremental user value:\r\n\r\n1. **01 Tauri scaffold** ƒ?\" establishes build/test harness.\r\n2. **04 Vault security** ƒ?\" secures storage before persisting user data.\r\n3. **18 Configuration & feature flags** ƒ?\" enables controlled rollout and privacy preferences.\r\n4. **02 Persona registry & IPC** ƒ?\" unblocks persona-aware features on a secure base.\r\n5. **05 Memory system** ƒ?\" persists shared context once vault/config ready.\r\n6. **12 Workspace hub** ƒ?\" surfaces persona/memory controls in the UI.\r\n7. **03 Local voice loop** ƒ?\" layers on voice interaction using established personas.\r\n8. **06 Integration & testing** ƒ?\" expands automation once core flows exist.\r\n9. **07 UI/UX polish** ƒ?\" improves accessibility after primary surfaces built.\r\n10. **08 Build & release** ƒ?\" finalises distribution workflows with earlier signing tasks.\r\n11. **09 Risk register** ƒ?\" institutionalises governance alongside build readiness.\r\n12. **10 Advanced backlog** ƒ?\" curate future work with telemetry from foundational features.\r\n13. **13 Synapse security** ƒ?\" harden external integrations after internal flows stabilise.\r\n14. **14 Sentry incident response** ƒ?\" wire alerting once Synapse signals exist.\r\n15. **11 Alice behavioural analysis** ƒ?\" introduce advanced persona once oversight, config, and response paths exist.\r\n16. **15 Mimic adaptive capabilities** ƒ?\" extend ML once Alice signals validated.\r\n17. **17 Proactive assistance** ƒ?\" roll out proactive UX leveraging prior analytics safeguards.\r\n18. **16 Predictive intelligence** ƒ?\" capstone intelligence once all guardrails and telemetry mature.\r\n\r\nDependencies in the plan should be updated to reflect these sequencing adjustments before sprint execution.\r\nQAOR owns verification that every issueƒ?Ts acceptance criteria incorporate the adjustments captured here and\r\ncoordinates with the relevant specialist agent before development begins.\r\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each change must note the\r\n   owning agent in commit summaries/PR descriptions and reflect that agent's\r\n   responsibilities.\r\n2. **Pair with QAOR** – every code or documentation change requires an explicit\r\n   verification note (tests run, manual checks, or follow-up tasks) so the QA\r\n   agent can trace coverage.  Capture skipped tests with rationale.\r\n3. **Trace to issues** – align work with the validated backlog\r\n   (`docs/planning/issues/issue-validation.md`).  Reference the relevant issue\r\n   number(s) in commits/PRs and ensure acceptance criteria remain satisfied.\r\n4. **Record learnings** – if work surfaces new risks or debt, update the risk\r\n   register (`docs/planning/risk-register.md`) or advanced backlog as part of\r\n   the same change.\r\n5. **Maintain artefacts** – update orchestration docs under\r\n   `docs/planning/codex-sprint/` whenever responsibilities, sequencing, or QA\r\n   expectations shift.\r\n\r\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository unless a deeper\r\n`AGENTS.md` overrides them.\r\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each change must note the\r\n   owning agent in commit summaries/PR descriptions and reflect that agent's\r\n   responsibilities.\r\n2. **Pair with QAOR** – every code or documentation change requires an explicit\r\n   verification note (tests run, manual checks, or follow-up tasks) so the QA\r\n   agent can trace coverage.  Capture skipped tests with rationale.\r\n3. **Trace to issues** – align work with the validated backlog\r\n   (`docs/planning/issues/issue-validation.md`).  Reference the relevant issue\r\n   number(s) in commits/PRs and ensure acceptance criteria remain satisfied.\r\n4. **Record learnings** – if work surfaces new risks or debt, update the risk\r\n   register (`docs/planning/risk-register.md`) or advanced backlog as part of\r\n   the same change.\r\n5. **Maintain artefacts** – update orchestration docs under\r\n   `docs/planning/codex-sprint/` whenever responsibilities, sequencing, or QA\r\n   expectations shift.\r\n\r\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository unless a deeper\r\n`AGENTS.md` overrides them.\r\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each change must note the\r\n   owning agent in commit summaries/PR descriptions and reflect that agent's\r\n   responsibilities.\r\n2. **Pair with QAOR** – every code or documentation change requires an explicit\r\n   verification note (tests run, manual checks, or follow-up tasks) so the QA\r\n   agent can trace coverage.  Capture skipped tests with rationale.\r\n3. **Trace to issues** – align work with the validated backlog\r\n   (`docs/planning/issues/issue-validation.md`).  Reference the relevant issue\r\n   number(s) in commits/PRs and ensure acceptance criteria remain satisfied.\r\n4. **Record learnings** – if work surfaces new risks or debt, update the risk\r\n   register (`docs/planning/risk-register.md`) or advanced backlog as part of\r\n   the same change.\r\n5. **Maintain artefacts** – update orchestration docs under\r\n   `docs/planning/codex-sprint/` whenever responsibilities, sequencing, or QA\r\n   expectations shift.\r\n\r\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository unless a deeper\r\n`AGENTS.md` overrides them.\r\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each change must note the\r\n   owning agent in commit summaries/PR descriptions and reflect that agent's\r\n   responsibilities.\r\n2. **Pair with QAOR** – every code or documentation change requires an explicit\r\n   verification note (tests run, manual checks, or follow-up tasks) so the QA\r\n   agent can trace coverage.  Capture skipped tests with rationale.\r\n3. **Trace to issues** – align work with the validated backlog\r\n   (`docs/planning/issues/issue-validation.md`).  Reference the relevant issue\r\n   number(s) in commits/PRs and ensure acceptance criteria remain satisfied.\r\n4. **Record learnings** – if work surfaces new risks or debt, update the risk\r\n   register (`docs/planning/risk-register.md`) or advanced backlog as part of\r\n   the same change.\r\n5. **Maintain artefacts** – update orchestration docs under\r\n   `docs/planning/codex-sprint/` whenever responsibilities, sequencing, or QA\r\n   expectations shift.\r\n\r\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository unless a deeper\r\n`AGENTS.md` overrides them.\r\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each change must note the\r\n   owning agent in commit summaries/PR descriptions and reflect that agent's\r\n   responsibilities.\r\n2. **Pair with QAOR** – every code or documentation change requires an explicit\r\n   verification note (tests run, manual checks, or follow-up tasks) so the QA\r\n   agent can trace coverage.  Capture skipped tests with rationale.\r\n3. **Trace to issues** – align work with the validated backlog\r\n   (`docs/planning/issues/issue-validation.md`).  Reference the relevant issue\r\n   number(s) in commits/PRs and ensure acceptance criteria remain satisfied.\r\n4. **Record learnings** – if work surfaces new risks or debt, update the risk\r\n   register (`docs/planning/risk-register.md`) or advanced backlog as part of\r\n   the same change.\r\n5. **Maintain artefacts** – update orchestration docs under\r\n   `docs/planning/codex-sprint/` whenever responsibilities, sequencing, or QA\r\n   expectations shift.\r\n\r\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository unless a deeper\r\n`AGENTS.md` overrides them.\r\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
