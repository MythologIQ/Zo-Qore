You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"e80fc5def8c8a2a9faef03e07165d01cc3aa8275","branch":"feature/synapse-marketplace-live","repository_url":"https://github.com/MythologIQ/Hearthlink.git"}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It enforces policies on high-risk actions before execution, with support for both shadow mode (log-only) and enforce mode (block violations).\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n\r\n- **High-Risk Action Detection**: Automatically identifies dangerous operations\r\n- **Policy Enforcement**: Shadow mode (log) or Enforce mode (block)\r\n- **Risk Classification**: Low, Medium, High, Critical levels\r\n- **Audit Logging**: Every policy check and decision is logged\r\n- **Statistics**: Track denial rates, confirmation rates, critical actions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n```\r\nUser Request\r\n    â†“\r\n[Policy Engine Check]\r\n    â†“\r\n[Policy Decision]\r\n    â†“\r\n[Action Execution or Block]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Components\r\n\r\n1. **PolicyAction**: Enum defining all high-risk action types\r\n2. **PolicyEngine**: Core engine that evaluates actions\r\n3. **PolicyContext**: Context for policy evaluation (agent, session, user)\r\n4. **PolicyDecision**: Result of policy evaluation (Allow/Deny/RequireConfirmation)\r\n5. **RiskLevel**: Classification of action severity\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## High-Risk Action Types\r\n\r\n### 1. File Deletion\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Critical (if unsandboxed), Low (if sandboxed)\r\n\r\n**Policy**:\r\n\r\n- **Sandboxed files**: Allow deletion\r\n- **Unsandboxed files**: Deny deletion (requires explicit approval)\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::FileDelete {\r\n    path: \"/tmp/test.txt\".into(),\r\n    is_sandboxed: true,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Email Sending\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Medium (no attachments), High (with attachments)\r\n\r\n**Policy**:\r\n\r\n- **No attachments**: Allow with confirmation\r\n- **With attachments**: Require user approval\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::EmailSend {\r\n    recipient: \"user@example.com\".into(),\r\n    subject: \"Test\".into(),\r\n    has_attachments: false,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. External API Calls\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Medium (no auth), High (with auth)\r\n\r\n**Policy**:\r\n\r\n- **No authentication**: Allow with monitoring\r\n- **With authentication**: Require explicit approval\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::ExternalApiCall {\r\n    url: \"https://api.example.com\".into(),\r\n    method: \"GET\".into(),\r\n    has_auth: false,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Database Schema Modifications\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Critical\r\n\r\n**Policy**: Always deny schema modifications in enforce mode\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::SchemaModification {\r\n    operation: \"ALTER\".into(),\r\n    table_name: \"users\".into(),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5. Credential Access\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Critical\r\n\r\n**Policy**: Always deny credential access in enforce mode\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::CredentialAccess {\r\n    credential_type: \"api_key\".into(),\r\n    service: \"OpenAI\".into(),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 6. Custom Actions\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Medium (default)\r\n\r\n**Policy**: Require user confirmation for custom actions\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::Custom {\r\n    action_type: \"custom_action\".into(),\r\n    details: serde_json::json!({ \"param\": \"value\" }),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Policy Modes\r\n\r\n### Shadow Mode (Default)\r\n\r\n**Behavior**: Log all policy checks and decisions, but do not block execution\r\n\r\n**Use Case**: Beta testing, initial deployment, learning period\r\n\r\n**Configuration**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet engine = PolicyEngine::new(db);\r\n// Engine defaults to Shadow mode\r\nassert_eq!(engine.get_mode(), PolicyMode::Shadow);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Enforce Mode\r\n\r\n**Behavior**: Block all policy violations before execution\r\n\r\n**Use Case**: Production, high-security environments\r\n\r\n**Configuration**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet config = PolicyEngineConfig {\r\n    mode: PolicyMode::Enforce,\r\n    verbose_logging: true,\r\n    custom_rules: None,\r\n};\r\nlet engine = PolicyEngine::with_config(db, config);\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Policy Decision Types\r\n\r\n### Allow\r\n\r\n**Description**: Action is permitted to proceed\r\n\r\n**Fields**:\r\n\r\n- `reason`: Explanation of why action is allowed\r\n- `confidence`: Confidence score

**Policy Engine Instance**: Available in `CoreOrchestrator`\r\n2. **Policy Checks**: Can be called before tool execution\r\n3. **Audit Logging**: All decisions are logged to the flight recorder\r\n\r\n### Example Integration\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// In orchestrator.rs\r\nuse crate::sentry::policy_engine::{PolicyAction, PolicyContext, PolicyEngine};\r\n\r\npub struct CoreOrchestrator {\r\n    db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>,\r\n    policy_engine: PolicyEngine,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl CoreOrchestrator {\r\n    pub fn new(db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>) -> Self {\r\n        let policy_engine = PolicyEngine::new(db.clone());\r\n        Self { db, policy_engine }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    pub async fn check_action_policy(&self, action: &PolicyAction, context: &PolicyContext) -> Result<PolicyDecision, String> {\r\n        self.policy_engine.check_policy(action, context).await\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Statistics & Metrics\r\n\r\n### Policy Statistics\r\n\r\nThe policy engine provides comprehensive statistics for monitoring:\r\n\r\n- **Total Checks**: Number of policy evaluations\r\n- **Denied Count**: Number of actions blocked\r\n- **Required Confirmation**: Number of actions requiring approval\r\n- **Critical Count**: Number of critical-risk actions\r\n- **Denial Rate**: Percentage of actions denied\r\n- **Confirmation Rate**: Percentage of actions requiring confirmation\r\n- **Critical Rate**: Percentage of critical-risk actions\r\n\r\n### Example Analytics Queries\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- Get policy statistics for last 24 hours\r\nSELECT\r\n    pc.risk_level,\r\n    pd.decision_type,\r\n    COUNT(*) as count\r\nFROM policy_checks pc\r\nJOIN policy_decisions pd ON pc.check_id = pd.check_id\r\nWHERE pc.timestamp >= datetime('now', '-24 hours')\r\nGROUP BY pc.risk_level, pd.decision_type;\r\n\r\n-- Calculate denial rate\r\nSELECT\r\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN pd.decision_type = 'deny' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as denial_rate_pct\r\nFROM policy_checks pc\r\nJOIN policy_decisions pd ON pc.check_id = pd.check_id\r\nWHERE pc.timestamp >= datetime('now', '-24 hours');\r\n\r\n-- Find most denied action types\r\nSELECT\r\n    pc.action_type,\r\n    COUNT(*) as denied_count\r\nFROM policy_checks pc\r\nJOIN policy_decisions pd ON pc.check_id = pd.check_id\r\nWHERE pd.decision_type = 'deny'\r\n  AND pc.timestamp >= datetime('now', '-24 hours')\r\nGROUP BY pc.action_type\r\nORDER BY denied_count DESC;\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\n\r\nThe policy engine includes comprehensive unit tests covering:\r\n\r\n1. **Risk Level Classification**: Tests for all action types\r\n2. **Policy Decision Logic**: Tests for allow/deny/require-confirmation\r\n3. **Serialization**: Tests for request/response structures\r\n4. **Statistics**: Tests for rate calculations\r\n5. **Policy Engine Configuration**: Tests for mode switching\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Run all policy engine tests\r\ncargo test --package hearthlink --lib sentry::policy_engine_tests\r\n\r\n# Run with output\r\ncargo test --package hearthlink --lib sentry::policy_engine_tests -- --nocapture\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n- âœ… Risk level classification: 100%\r\n- âœ… Action categories: 100%\r\n- âœ… Policy decisions: 100%\r\n- âœ… Serialization/deserialization: 100%\r\n- âœ… Statistics calculations: 100%\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\n### Fail-Closed Design\r\n\r\nThe policy engine follows a fail-closed security model:\r\n\r\n- **Default Deny**: If policy is unclear, action is denied\r\n- **Explicit Allow**: Only actions explicitly allowed by policy proceed\r\n- **Audit Trail**: Every check and decision is logged\r\n- **User Ownership**: All checks tied to user_id for accountability\r\n\r\n### Data Minimization\r\n\r\nPolicy check data is minimized before storage:\r\n\r\n- Action details stored as JSON (not full objects)\r\n- Only essential fields logged (action_type, risk_level, decision)\r\n- No sensitive payload data in audit logs\r\n\r\n### Immutability\r\n\r\nPolicy decisions cannot be modified once recorded:\r\n\r\n- Database constraints prevent updates\r\n- Append-only design for audit trails\r\n- Timestamps for forensic analysis\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\n- **Policy Check Latency**: < 1ms (in-memory evaluation)\r\n- **Database Write**: < 5ms (indexed inserts)\r\n- **Statistics Query**: < 10ms (aggregated queries)\r\n\r\n### Optimization Strategies\r\n\r\n1. **Index Strategy**: Composite indexes on (agent, timestamp) for fast queries\r\n2. **Batch Logging**: Multiple policy decisions logged in single transaction\r\n3. **Caching**: Policy rules cached in memory (future enhancement)\r\n4. **Connection Pooling**: Read/write pool separation to prevent contention\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Common Issues\r\n\r\n#### Issue: Policy checks not being executed\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Actions bypass policy engine\r\n- Policy decisions not logged\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Verify policy engine is initialized in orchestrator\r\n2. Check database migration was applied (migration 005)\r\n3. Review logs for policy check errors\r\n\r\n#### Issue: High denial rate\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Many actions being denied\r\n- User experience degraded\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Review policy rules for overly restrictive settings\r\n2. Check if agents are requesting appropriate actions\r\n3. Consider adjusting risk level classifications\r\n4. Enable shadow mode temporarily to understand patterns\r\n\r\n#### Issue: Statistics not updating\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Stats show zero checks\r\n- Dashboard displays incorrect data\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Verify database write permissions\r\n2. Check audit log table exists\r\n3. Review policy engine logging configuration\r\n4. Check database connection pool health\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Planned Features\r\n\r\n1. **Custom Policy Rules**: User-defined policy rules\r\n2. **Policy Templates**: Pre-configured rule sets for different scenarios\r\n3. **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection in policy violations\r\n4. **Policy Recommendations**: Suggest policy improvements based on usage patterns\r\n5. **Real-time Alerts**: Push notifications for critical violations\r\n6. **Policy Rollback**: Ability to revert policy changes\r\n7. **Policy Versioning**: Track policy changes over time\r\n8. **Multi-User Policies**: Different policies per user or group\r\n9. **Policy Exemptions**: Allow-list for trusted agents/actions\r\n10. **Policy Analytics Dashboard**: Visual policy compliance metrics\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## API Reference\r\n\r\n### PolicyAction Enum\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub enum PolicyAction {\r\n    FileDelete { path: String, is_sandboxed: bool },\r\n    EmailSend { recipient: String, subject: String, has_attachments: bool },\r\n    ExternalApiCall { url: String, method: String, has_auth: bool },\r\n    SchemaModification { operation: String, table_name: String },\r\n    CredentialAccess { credential_type: String, service: String },\r\n    Custom { action_type: String, details: Value },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### PolicyDecision Enum\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub enum PolicyDecision {\r\n    Allow { reason: String, confidence: f32 },\r\n    Deny { reason: String, risk_level: RiskLevel },\r\n    RequireConfirmation { reason: String, risk_level: RiskLevel, suggested_approvals: Vec<String> },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### PolicyEngine Methods\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl PolicyEngine {\r\n    pub fn new(db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>) -> Self;\r\n    pub fn with_config(db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>, config: PolicyEngineConfig) -> Self;\r\n    pub async fn check_policy(&self, action: &PolicyAction, context: &PolicyContext) -> Result<PolicyDecision, String>;\r\n    pub fn get_mode(&self) -> PolicyMode;\r\n    pub fn set_mode(&mut self, mode: PolicyMode);\r\n    pub async fn get_policy_stats(&self, user_id: &str, hours: u32) -> Result<PolicyStats, String>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- **Related Modules**:\r\n  - [`FlightRecorder`](./flight_recorder.md): Audit logging for all policy decisions\r\n  - [`AuditCommands`](./audit_commands.md): Tauri commands for audit operations\r\n  - [`Orchestrator`](../../core/orchestrator.md): Integration point for policy checks\r\n\r\n- **Database Schema**:\r\n  - [`005_policy_engine_flight_recorder.sql`](../../migrations/005_policy_engine_flight_recorder.sql): Database migration\r\n\r\n- **Test Suite**:\r\n  - [`policy_engine_tests.rs`](./policy_engine_tests.rs): Comprehensive unit tests\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Document Status**: âœ… Complete  \r\n**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31\r\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

console.error(\"Failed to prune:\", response.error);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Integration Points\r\n\r\n### Orchestrator Integration\r\n\r\nThe flight recorder is integrated into the orchestrator at multiple points:\r\n\r\n1. **Agent Message Logging**: All agent-to-agent messages are logged\r\n2. **Validation Logging**: Alignment validator results are logged\r\n3. **Context Tracking**: Every event includes session and user context\r\n\r\n### Example Integration\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// In orchestrator.rs\r\nuse crate::sentry::audit::{AuditContext, AuditEvent, FlightRecorder};\r\n\r\npub struct CoreOrchestrator {\r\n    db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>,\r\n    flight_recorder: FlightRecorder,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl CoreOrchestrator {\r\n    pub async fn log_agent_messages(\r\n        &self,\r\n        session_id: &str,\r\n        user_id: &str,\r\n        user_message: &OrchestratedMessage,\r\n        alden_to_core: &OrchestratedMessage,\r\n        core_to_alice: &OrchestratedMessage,\r\n    ) -> Result<(), String> {\r\n        let context = AuditContext {\r\n            session_id: session_id.to_string(),\r\n            user_id: user_id.to_string(),\r\n            agent_id: None,\r\n            metadata: None,\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        // Log each message\r\n        let user_event = AuditEvent::agent_message(\r\n            \"user\".to_string(),\r\n            format!(\"{:?}\", user_message.to),\r\n            serde_json::to_string(&user_message.payload).unwrap_or_default(),\r\n            user_message.message_id.clone(),\r\n        );\r\n        let _ = self.flight_recorder.log_event(user_event, context.clone()).await;\r\n\r\n        // ... log other messages\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\n\r\nThe flight recorder includes comprehensive unit tests covering:\r\n\r\n1. **Event Creation**: Tests for all event types\r\n2. **Event Serialization**: Tests for request/response structures\r\n3. **Query Filtering**: Tests for filter combinations\r\n4. **Statistics Calculation**: Tests for rate calculations\r\n5. **Export Functionality**: Tests for JSON/CSV export\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Run all flight recorder tests\r\ncargo test --package hearthlink --lib sentry::audit_tests\r\n\r\n# Run with output\r\ncargo test --package hearthlink --lib sentry::audit_tests -- --nocapture\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n- âœ… Event type creation: 100%\r\n- âœ… Event serialization/deserialization: 100%\r\n- âœ… Query filters: 100%\r\n- âœ… Statistics calculation: 100%\r\n- âœ… Export functionality: 100%\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\n### Immutability\r\n\r\nAudit log entries cannot be modified once recorded:\r\n\r\n- Database constraints prevent updates\r\n- Append-only design for audit trails\r\n- Timestamps for forensic analysis\r\n\r\n### Data Minimization\r\n\r\nAudit log data is minimized before storage:\r\n\r\n- Event payloads stored as JSON (not full objects)\r\n- Only essential fields logged (event_type, agent, payload)\r\n- No sensitive payload data in audit logs\r\n\r\n### User Ownership\r\n\r\nAll audit events are tied to user_id for accountability:\r\n\r\n- Every event includes user_id\r\n- Queries can be filtered by user\r\n- Statistics calculated per user\r\n\r\n### Access Control\r\n\r\nAudit log queries respect user boundaries:\r\n\r\n- Users can only query their own events\r\n- User ID validation on all queries\r\n- Session-based access control\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\n- **Event Logging Latency**: < 1ms (in-memory)\r\n- **Database Write**: < 5ms (indexed inserts)\r\n- **Query Performance**: < 10ms (aggregated queries)\r\n- **JSON Export**: < 100ms for 1000 events\r\n- **CSV Export**: < 50ms for 1000 events\r\n\r\n### Optimization Strategies\r\n\r\n1. **Index Strategy**: Composite indexes on (timestamp, session, agent, event_type)\r\n2. **Batch Logging**: Multiple events logged in single transaction\r\n3. **Query Caching**: Recent queries cached in memory (future enhancement)\r\n4. **Connection Pooling**: Read/write pool separation to prevent contention\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Common Issues\r\n\r\n#### Issue: Events not being logged\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Agent messages not appearing in queries\r\n- Statistics showing zero events\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Verify flight recorder is initialized in orchestrator\r\n2. Check database migration was applied (migration 005)\r\n3. Review logs for logging errors\r\n4. Check database write permissions\r\n\r\n#### Issue: Queries returning empty results\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- No events found for valid time range\r\n- Filters not working as expected\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Verify filter format (ISO8601 timestamps)\r\n2. Check database indexes are created\r\n3. Review query execution plan\r\n4. Test with simpler filters first\r\n\r\n#### Issue: Export failing\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Export returns empty string\r\n- JSON parse errors\r\n- CSV formatting issues\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Check database connection is active\r\n2. Verify event data is valid JSON\r\n3. Test with smaller time ranges first\r\n4. Check available disk space\r\n\r\n#### Issue: Performance degradation\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Queries taking longer than expected\r\n- Export is slow\r\n- Dashboard updates lagging\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Check database index health\r\n2. Review query execution plans\r\n3. Consider archiving old events\r\n4. Optimize filter queries\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\n### Planned Features\r\n\r\n1. **Real-time Streaming**: Push notifications for new events\r\n2. **Event Search**: Full-text search across audit log\r\n3. **Event Correlation**: Link related events (e.g., tool call â†’ result)\r\n4. **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning for unusual patterns\r\n5. **Compliance Reports**: Automated report generation\r\n6. **Event Retention**: Configurable retention policies\r\n7. **Multi-tenant Support**: Separate audit logs per organization\r\n8. **Audit Dashboard**: Visual timeline and analytics UI\r\n9. **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for critical events\r\n10. **Audit Trail Export**: Enhanced export formats (PDF, XML)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## API Reference\r\n\r\n### AuditEvent Enum\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub enum AuditEvent {\r\n    AgentMessage { from: String, to: String, content: String, message_id: String },\r\n    ToolCall { tool_name: String, parameters: Value, result: Option<Value>, duration_ms: Option<u64> },\r\n    PolicyCheck { action_type: String, action_details: Value, decision: String, reason: String, risk_level: String },\r\n    Signal { signal_type: String, reason: Option<String>, triggered_by: String },\r\n    Validation { agent_id: String, validated: bool, aligned: bool, severity: Option<String>, reason: Option<String> },\r\n    DataAccess { data_type: String, action: String, data_summary: String, minimized: bool },\r\n    Error { error_type: String, error_message: String, stack_trace: Option<String> },\r\n    Custom { payload_type: String, data: Value },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### FlightRecorder Methods\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl FlightRecorder {\r\n    pub fn new(db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>) -> Self;\r\n    pub async fn log_event(&self, event: AuditEvent, context: AuditContext) -> Result<(), String>;\r\n    pub async fn query_events(&self, filters: AuditQueryFilters) -> Result<Vec<AuditLogEntry>, String>;\r\n    pub async fn export_to_json(&self, filters: AuditQueryFilters) -> Result<String, String>;\r\n    pub async fn export_to_csv(&self, filters: AuditQueryFilters) -> Result<String, String>;\r\n    pub async fn get_audit_stats(&self, user_id: &str, hours: u32) -> Result<AuditStats, String>;\r\n    pub async fn prune_old_entries(&self, older_than_hours: u32) -> Result<u64, String>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- **Related Modules**:\r\n  - [`PolicyEngine`](./POLICY_ENGINE.md): Policy decisions logged to flight recorder\r\n  - [`AuditCommands`](./audit_commands.md): Tauri commands for audit operations\r\n  - [`Orchestrator`](../../core/orchestrator.md): Integration point for event logging\r\n\r\n- **Database Schema**:\r\n  - [`005_policy_engine_flight_recorder.sql`](../../migrations/005_policy_engine_flight_recorder.sql): Database migration\r\n\r\n- **Test Suite**:\r\n  - [`audit_tests.rs`](../sentry/audit_tests.rs): Comprehensive unit tests\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Document Status**: âœ… Complete  \r\n**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31\r\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It enforces policies on high-risk actions before execution, with support for both shadow mode (log-only) and enforce mode (block violations).\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n\r\n- **High-Risk Action Detection**: Automatically identifies dangerous operations\r\n- **Policy Enforcement**: Shadow mode (log) or Enforce mode (block)\r\n- **Risk Classification**: Low, Medium, High, Critical levels\r\n- **Audit Logging**: Every policy check and decision is logged\r\n- **Statistics**: Track denial rates, confirmation rates, critical actions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n```\r\nUser Request\r\n    â†“\r\n[Policy Engine Check]\r\n    â†“\r\n[Policy Decision]\r\n    â†“\r\n[Action Execution or Block]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Components\r\n\r\n1. **PolicyAction**: Enum defining all high-risk action types\r\n2. **PolicyEngine**: Core engine that evaluates actions\r\n3. **PolicyContext**: Context for policy evaluation (agent, session, user)\r\n4. **PolicyDecision**: Result of policy evaluation (Allow/Deny/RequireConfirmation)\r\n5. **RiskLevel**: Classification of action severity\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## High-Risk Action Types\r\n\r\n### 1. File Deletion\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Critical (if unsandboxed), Low (if sandboxed)\r\n\r\n**Policy**:\r\n\r\n- **Sandboxed files**: Allow deletion\r\n- **Unsandboxed files**: Deny deletion (requires explicit approval)\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::FileDelete {\r\n    path: \"/tmp/test.txt\".into(),\r\n    is_sandboxed: true,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Email Sending\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Medium (no attachments), High (with attachments)\r\n\r\n**Policy**:\r\n\r\n- **No attachments**: Allow with confirmation\r\n- **With attachments**: Require user approval\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::EmailSend {\r\n    recipient: \"user@example.com\".into(),\r\n    subject: \"Test\".into(),\r\n    has_attachments: false,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. External API Calls\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Medium (no auth), High (with auth)\r\n\r\n**Policy**:\r\n\r\n- **No authentication**: Allow with monitoring\r\n- **With authentication**: Require explicit approval\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::ExternalApiCall {\r\n    url: \"https://api.example.com\".into(),\r\n    method: \"GET\".into(),\r\n    has_auth: false,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Database Schema Modifications\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Critical\r\n\r\n**Policy**: Always deny schema modifications in enforce mode\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::SchemaModification {\r\n    operation: \"ALTER\".into(),\r\n    table_name: \"users\".into(),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5. Credential Access\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Critical\r\n\r\n**Policy**: Always deny credential access in enforce mode\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::CredentialAccess {\r\n    credential_type: \"api_key\".into(),\r\n    service: \"OpenAI\".into(),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 6. Custom Actions\r\n\r\n**Risk Level**: Medium (default)\r\n\r\n**Policy**: Require user confirmation for custom actions\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet action = PolicyAction::Custom {\r\n    action_type: \"custom_action\".into(),\r\n    details: serde_json::json!({ \"param\": \"value\" }),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Policy Modes\r\n\r\n### Shadow Mode (Default)\r\n\r\n**Behavior**: Log all policy checks and decisions, but do not block execution\r\n\r\n**Use Case**: Beta testing, initial deployment, learning period\r\n\r\n**Configuration**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet engine = PolicyEngine::new(db);\r\n// Engine defaults to Shadow mode\r\nassert_eq!(engine.get_mode(), PolicyMode::Shadow);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Enforce Mode\r\n\r\n**Behavior**: Block all policy violations before execution\r\n\r\n**Use Case**: Production, high-security environments\r\n\r\n**Configuration**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet config = PolicyEngineConfig {\r\n    mode: PolicyMode::Enforce,\r\n    verbose_logging: true,\r\n    custom_rules: None,\r\n};\r\nlet engine = PolicyEngine::with_config(db, config);\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Policy Decision Types\r\n\r\n###

**Policy Engine Instance**: Available in `CoreOrchestrator`\r\n2. **Policy Checks**: Can be called before tool execution\r\n3. **Audit Logging**: All decisions are logged to the flight recorder\r\n\r\n### Example Integration\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// In orchestrator.rs\r\nuse crate::sentry::policy_engine::{PolicyAction, PolicyContext, PolicyEngine};\r\n\r\npub struct CoreOrchestrator {\r\n    db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>,\r\n    policy_engine: PolicyEngine,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl CoreOrchestrator {\r\n    pub fn new(db: Arc<RwLock<Option<DatabaseManager>>>) -> Self {\r\n        let policy_engine = PolicyEngine::new(db.clone());\r\n        Self { db, policy_engine }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    pub async fn check_action_policy(&self, action: &PolicyAction, context: &PolicyContext) -> Result<PolicyDecision, String> {\r\n        self.policy_engine.check_policy(action, context).await\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Statistics & Metrics\r\n\r\n### Policy Statistics\r\n\r\nThe policy engine provides comprehensive statistics for monitoring:\r\n\r\n- **Total Checks**: Number of policy evaluations\r\n- **Denied Count**: Number of actions blocked\r\n- **Required Confirmation**: Number of actions requiring approval\r\n- **Critical Count**: Number of critical-risk actions\r\n- **Denial Rate**: Percentage of actions denied\r\n- **Confirmation Rate**: Percentage of actions requiring confirmation\r\n- **Critical Rate**: Percentage of critical-risk actions\r\n\r\n### Example Analytics Queries\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- Get policy statistics for last 24 hours\r\nSELECT\r\n    pc.risk_level,\r\n    pd.decision_type,\r\n    COUNT(*) as count\r\nFROM policy_checks pc\r\nJOIN policy_decisions pd ON pc.check_id = pd.check_id\r\nWHERE pc.timestamp >= datetime('now', '-24 hours')\r\nGROUP BY pc.risk_level, pd.decision_type;\r\n\r\n-- Calculate denial rate\r\nSELECT\r\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN pd.decision_type = 'deny' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as denial_rate_pct\r\nFROM policy_checks pc\r\nJOIN policy_decisions pd ON pc.check_id = pd.check_id\r\nWHERE pc.timestamp >= datetime('now', '-24 hours');\r\n\r\n-- Find most denied action types\r\nSELECT\r\n    pc.action_type,\r\n    COUNT(*) as denied_count\r\nFROM policy_checks pc\r\nJOIN policy_decisions pd ON pc.check_id = pd.check_id\r\nWHERE pd.decision_type = 'deny'\r\n  AND pc.timestamp >= datetime('now', '-24 hours')\r\nGROUP BY pc.action_type\r\nORDER BY denied_count DESC;\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\n\r\nThe policy engine includes comprehensive unit tests covering:\r\n\r\n1. **Risk Level Classification**: Tests for all action types\r\n2. **Policy Decision Logic**: Tests for allow/deny/require-confirmation\r\n3. **Serialization**: Tests for request/response structures\r\n4. **Statistics**: Tests for rate calculations\r\n5. **Policy Engine Configuration**: Tests for mode switching\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Run all policy engine tests\r\ncargo test --package hearthlink --lib sentry::policy_engine_tests\r\n\r\n# Run with output\r\ncargo test --package hearthlink --lib sentry::policy_engine_tests -- --nocapture\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n- âœ… Risk level classification: 100%\r\n- âœ… Action categories: 100%\r\n- âœ… Policy decisions: 100%\r\n- âœ… Serialization/deserialization: 100%\r\n- âœ… Statistics calculations: 100%\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\n### Fail-Closed Design\r\n\r\nThe policy engine follows a fail-closed security model:\r\n\r\n- **Default Deny**: If policy is unclear, action is denied\r\n- **Explicit Allow**: Only actions explicitly allowed by policy proceed\r\n- **Audit Trail**: Every check and decision is logged\r\n- **User Ownership**: All checks tied to user_id for accountability\r\n\r\n### Data Minimization\r\n\r\nPolicy check data is minimized before storage:\r\n\r\n- Action details stored as JSON (not full objects)\r\n- Only essential fields logged (action_type, risk_level, decision)\r\n- No sensitive payload data in audit logs\r\n\r\n### Immutability\r\n\r\nPolicy decisions cannot be modified once recorded:\r\n\r\n- Database constraints prevent updates\r\n- Append-only design for audit trails\r\n- Timestamps for forensic analysis\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\n- **Policy Check Latency**: < 1ms (in-memory evaluation)\r\n- **Database Write**: < 5ms (indexed inserts)\r\n- **Statistics Query**: < 10ms (aggregated queries)\r\n\r\n### Optimization Strategies\r\n\r\n1. **Index Strategy**: Composite indexes on (agent, timestamp) for fast queries\r\n2. **Batch Logging**: Multiple policy decisions logged in single transaction\r\n3. **Caching**: Policy rules cached in memory (future enhancement)\r\n4. **Connection Pooling**: Read/write pool separation to prevent contention\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n### Common Issues\r\n\r\n#### Issue: Policy checks not being executed\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Actions bypass policy engine\r\n- Policy decisions not logged\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Verify policy engine is initialized in orchestrator\r\n2. Check database migration was applied (migration 005)\r\n3. Review logs for policy check errors\r\n\r\n#### Issue: High denial rate\r\n\r\n**Symptoms**:\r\n\r\n- Many actions being denied\r\n- User experience degraded\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n1. Review policy rules for overly restrictive settings\r\n2. Check if agents are requesting appropriate actions\r\n3. Consider adjusting risk level classifications\r\n4.

Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink.

Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink.

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
