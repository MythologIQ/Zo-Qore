This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

If this mode is paired with `danger-full-access`, take advantage of it to deliver the best outcome for the user.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Product Vision\r\n\r\nHearthlink is a **neuro-adaptive, local-first AI ecosystem** designed to support users with executive function challenges (ADHD). Unlike traditional assistants that wait for commands, Hearthlink is a **proactive partner** that learns patterns, manages energy, and secures digital privacy.\r\n\r\n### Core Philosophy\r\n\r\n1.  **Local-First:** All data lives on the user's device. No cloud dependencies for core logic.\r\n2.  **Privacy-By-Design:** \"Vault\" architecture ensures memory is encrypted (AES-256-GCM) and segmented.\r\n3.  **Neuro-Adaptive:** The system adapts to the user's energy levels and focus state (Deep Work).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Technical Architecture\r\n\r\n- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite (MythTech Design System)\r\n- **Backend:** Rust (Tauri) for high-performance logic and system integration.\r\n- **IPC:** \"Pure IPC\" model; no local HTTP servers. Secure command patterns.\r\n- **AI/ML:** Local inference (Ollama) via `Synapse` bridge.\r\n- **Database:** SQLite (Encrypted) managed by `db_manager.rs`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3.

Human by Design. Local by Default.\r\n1. Executive Summary\r\nHearthlink is a local-first AI assistant platform that solves the \"Faustian bargain\" of modern AI: the sacrifice of privacy for productivity. By moving the entire AI stackƒ?\"from the vector database to the LLMƒ?\"onto consumer hardware, Hearthlink eliminates cloud compute costs, mitigates $10M+ data breach risks, and provides a \"Balanced Team\" of AI personas designed for cognitive dignity and neurodivergent support.The Opportunity: Capitalizing on the $8.5B Agentic AI market and the 54% market penetration of AI PCs in 2026.2. Technical Architecture: The \"Sovereign Stack\"Model Strategy (Quantized On-Device LLMs)Hearthlink operates within a strictly local execution environment, typically constrained to ƒ%^8GB RAM. We utilize the Ollama engine to manage a rotation of high-capability, small-scale models:Primary Models: LLaMA 3.x (8B) and Mistral 7B, typically in 4-bit format (~3ƒ?\"5GB footprint).Performance: A 3B model yields 1ƒ?\"3 second response times on standard CPUs; 7ƒ?\"8B models are utilized for higher-accuracy reasoning tasks.Caching & Backend: The system maintains a default 4GB memory cache and can fall back to GPT4All or llama.cpp backends to ensure cross-hardware compatibility.Zero-Data Outbound: No inference data ever leaves the device, providing structural privacy and eliminating marginal compute costs.\"Vault\" RAG Architecture (Local Memory & Low-Latency Retrieval)The Vault is Hearthlinkƒ?Ts encrypted, persistent memory spine. It enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) without third-party cloud indexes.Encryption: Secured via AES-256 with per-record keys and tamper-evident audit logs.Hybrid Search Strategy:CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation): Interaction history (<1ms latency).Memory Slices: Active persona context (~10ms latency).Vector Store: ChromaDB using MiniLM-L6-v2 SentenceTransformers (384-dim vectors) for semantic recall (~100ms latency).Structured Indexing: SQLite-backed keyword indexing for high-precision filtering by tags, persona source, and timestamps.3. Persona Orchestration: The Multi-Agent SystemHearthlink is not a monolithic chatbot; it is a multi-agent coordination layer managed by the Core module.Alden (The Executive): The productivity engine. Alden handles task management and high-level reasoning, pulling from the Vault to align with user goals.Alice (The Contextual Analyst): A behavioral specialist designed with neurodivergent support in mind. Alice monitors sentiment, pace, and interaction patterns to suggest interventions before user burnout.Mimic (The Specialist Engine): An extensible \"Meta-Persona\" that allows users to generate bespoke agents (e.g., a \"Research Analyst\" or \"Coding Help\") on the fly.Sentry (The Guardian): The security watchdog. Sentry monitors external integrations via the Synapse gateway, flagging policy violations in plain language.4. Scientific Grounding & Behavioral ValidationWe distinguish Hearthlink from \"hallucinatory\" AI by anchoring the Alice persona in established Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research:Cognitive Load Proxy: Aliceƒ?Ts behavioralAnalysisService tracks error rates, response latency, and task-switching frequencyƒ?\"verified markers of cognitive strain.ADHD Support: Features like \"Hyperfocus Nudges\" (interrupting deep-work loops) and \"Daily Check-ins\" (providing executive function scaffolding) are based on ADHD coaching methodologies.Physiological Integration: The system supports opt-in heart rate monitoring to detect stress-induced spikes, prompting Alden to suggest task rescheduling.5. Engineering Roadmap: The Path to BetaVault Integration: Finalizing the bridge between the long-term vector store and Aldenƒ?Ts response generation to eliminate context-loss.Compliance Tooling: Mapping existing audit logs to GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 frameworks to prepare for enterprise adoption.Predictive Intelligence: Implementing a temporal analysis layer to forecast \"Focus Drops\" and suggest breaks based on historical usage patterns.External Audit: Engaging a third-party security firm to conduct a penetration test on the Vault and the Synapse plugin sandbox.6. Business Model & FinancialsSeed Round Ask: $700K ƒ?\" $1MRunway: 12ƒ?\"15 months.Allocation: 70% Engineering (3-person dev team), 10% Security Audits, 10% GTM, 10% Contingency.The Economic EdgeBecause Hearthlink runs on user hardware, our Gross Margin is ƒ%^90%.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
