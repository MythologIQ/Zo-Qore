System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Verified manually. `AuthProvider` correctly managing session state.\r\n- **E2E Validation:** Гs Л,? Partial Pass (Logic verified, UI timeouts in CI).\r\n  - Critical fix: Tutorial Overlay issue resolved.\r\n- **Visual Verification:** Гo. **PASS**.\r\n  - **Aesthetics:** Verified \"MythTech\" (Navy/Cyan/Gold) theme is consistent.\r\n  - **Functionality:** Alden Chat Гo., Vault Search Гo. (Graceful failure without backend).\r\n  - **Radial Menu Routing**: **FIXED**.\r\n    - **Issue:** Synapse, Vault, Sentry, and Mimic modules were redirecting to the launcher instead of their respective pages when navigating via the radial menu.\r\n    - **Resolution:** Identified that `HearthlinkApp.tsx` (the parent component for \"existing\" UI mode) was failing to pass `onNavigateToModule` to these specific module command centers. Added the missing prop propagation.\r\n    - **Verification:** Verified via browser automation that navigation from Mimic -> Synapse -> Vault works correctly and titles display as expected.\r\n  - **Fixes:** Patched `AldenTerminal` runtime error, `UnifiedHearthlinkApp` routing props, and unified `AliceCommandCenter` UI (Header/Sidebar/TZ).\r\n  - **Expanded Chat UI Refinement:** Гo. **VERIFIED**.\r\n    - **Layout:** Active Agent column widened to ~400px.\r\n    - **Header Consistency:** All 4 columns (System, Bridge, Active, Private) fixed to exactly **56px** height.\r\n    - **Active Agent Panel:**\r\n      - **Avatar:** Portrait mode (9:16 aspect ratio) matching design.\r\n      - **Controls:** \"Bridge\" and \"Native\" buttons reduced to small size (w-14, 8px text).\r\n    - **Consistency:** Chat tab verified in all modules.\r\n    - **Fullscreen Height:** Verified 919px height for Chat tab in all modules.\r\n    - **Identity:** Vault Resident AI confirmed as Sentry. Verified headers.\r\n- **Next Steps:** Prepare Release Candidate 1.0.\r\n\r\n- **Core Module Stability:** Гo. **FIXED**.\r\n  - **Issue:** \"Session not loaded\" crash causing navigation loops.\r\n  - **Resolution:** `CoreBridge` now auto-creates sessions or falls back to offline mode.\r\n  - **Visuals:** Fixed Time Zone dropdown contrast and Sidebar visibility (removed dark overlays).\r\n  - **Error Handling:** Suppressed \"No active session\" error on initial load for cleaner UI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Design Philosophy: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)\r\n\r\n> All implementations must prioritize simplicity, clarity, and maintainability over feature complexity.\r\n\r\n### Enforcement Principles\r\n\r\n1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component does ONE thing well\r\n2. **Minimal Props**: Pass only what's needed, derive the rest\r\n3. **Composition over Complexity**: Build complex UIs from simple building blocks\r\n4. **Direct Communication**: Minimize layers of indirection\r\n5. **Readable State**: State should be obvious from component structure\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Universal Chat Architecture\r\n\r\n### Documented Design (Master Doc Section 5 + Appendix EE)\r\n\r\nThe Universal Chat is the **primary user interface for Core Sessions**, enabling:\r\n\r\n- Multi-persona interaction\r\n- Context switching between AI agents\r\n- Future avatar integration\r\n\r\n### Current Implementation Status\r\n\r\n| Component           | Path                                | Status         | KISS Compliant  |\r\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\r\n| `UnifiedChatLayout` | `shared/chat/UnifiedChatLayout.tsx` | Гo.

[ ] Verify SidebarChat 3-state functionality in browser\r\n2. [ ] Update ACTUAL_STATUS.md with current state\r\n3. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to VaultDashboard\r\n4.
