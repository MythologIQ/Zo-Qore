Each agent has a distinct role and is configured with a specific skill prompt from the `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n## Core Development Team\n\n### 1. Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Verified manually. `AuthProvider` correctly managing session state.\r\n- **E2E Validation:** Гs Л,? Partial Pass (Logic verified, UI timeouts in CI).\r\n  - Critical fix: Tutorial Overlay issue resolved.\r\n- **Visual Verification:** Гo. **PASS**.\r\n  - **Aesthetics:** Verified \"MythTech\" (Navy/Cyan/Gold) theme is consistent.\r\n  - **Functionality:** Alden Chat Гo., Vault Search Гo. (Graceful failure without backend).\r\n  - **Radial Menu Routing**: **FIXED**.\r\n    - **Issue:** Synapse, Vault, Sentry, and Mimic modules were redirecting to the launcher instead of their respective pages when navigating via the radial menu.\r\n    - **Resolution:** Identified that `HearthlinkApp.tsx` (the parent component for \"existing\" UI mode) was failing to pass `onNavigateToModule` to these specific module command centers. Added the missing prop propagation.\r\n    - **Verification:** Verified via browser automation that navigation from Mimic -> Synapse -> Vault works correctly and titles display as expected.\r\n  - **Fixes:** Patched `AldenTerminal` runtime error, `UnifiedHearthlinkApp` routing props, and unified `AliceCommandCenter` UI (Header/Sidebar/TZ).\r\n  - **Expanded Chat UI Refinement:** Гo. **VERIFIED**.\r\n    - **Layout:** Active Agent column widened to ~400px.\r\n    - **Header Consistency:** All 4 columns (System, Bridge, Active, Private) fixed to exactly **56px** height.\r\n    - **Active Agent Panel:**\r\n      - **Avatar:** Portrait mode (9:16 aspect ratio) matching design.\r\n      - **Controls:** \"Bridge\" and \"Native\" buttons reduced to small size (w-14, 8px text).\r\n    - **Consistency:** Chat tab verified in all modules.\r\n    - **Fullscreen Height:** Verified 919px height for Chat tab in all modules.\r\n    - **Identity:** Vault Resident AI confirmed as Sentry. Verified headers.\r\n- **Next Steps:** Prepare Release Candidate 1.0.\r\n\r\n- **Core Module Stability:** Гo. **FIXED**.\r\n  - **Issue:** \"Session not loaded\" crash causing navigation loops.\r\n  - **Resolution:** `CoreBridge` now auto-creates sessions or falls back to offline mode.\r\n  - **Visuals:** Fixed Time Zone dropdown contrast and Sidebar visibility (removed dark overlays).\r\n  - **Error Handling:** Suppressed \"No active session\" error on initial load for cleaner UI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Design Philosophy: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)\r\n\r\n> All implementations must prioritize simplicity, clarity, and maintainability over feature complexity.\r\n\r\n### Enforcement Principles\r\n\r\n1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component does ONE thing well\r\n2. **Minimal Props**: Pass only what's needed, derive the rest\r\n3. **Composition over Complexity**: Build complex UIs from simple building blocks\r\n4. **Direct Communication**: Minimize layers of indirection\r\n5. **Readable State**: State should be obvious from component structure\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Universal Chat Architecture\r\n\r\n### Documented Design (Master Doc Section 5 + Appendix EE)\r\n\r\nThe Universal Chat is the **primary user interface for Core Sessions**, enabling:\r\n\r\n- Multi-persona interaction\r\n- Context switching between AI agents\r\n- Future avatar integration\r\n\r\n### Current Implementation Status\r\n\r\n| Component           | Path                                | Status         | KISS Compliant  |\r\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\r\n| `UnifiedChatLayout` | `shared/chat/UnifiedChatLayout.tsx` | Гo.

Using `createPortal(jsx, document.body)` renders it at the root level.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Module Resident AI Mapping\r\n\r\n| Module          | Resident AI | Color Theme      |\r\n| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |\r\n| Alden (default) | Alden       | Gold (#d6b369)   |\r\n| Core            | Alden       | Gold             |\r\n| Vault           | Sentry      | Red (#ef4444)    |\r\n| Alice           | Alice       | Blue (#3b82f6)   |\r\n| Mimic           | Mimic       | Purple (#a855f7) |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n1. **SidebarChat expand/collapse** - Buttons not fully wired; need visual verification\r\n2. **Ghost chat window** - May appear if UnifiedCommandCenter's default GlobalCommsStream shows behind custom sidebar\r\n3. **ACTUAL_STATUS.md** - Outdated (Oct 2025), needs update after current fixes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps (Priority Order)\r\n\r\n1. [ ] Verify SidebarChat 3-state functionality in browser\r\n2. [ ] Update ACTUAL_STATUS.md with current state\r\n3. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to VaultDashboard\r\n4. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to other module dashboards\r\n5. [ ] Address 8 accessibility E2E failures\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Alignment Checklist\r\n\r\n### Master Documentation Alignment\r\n\r\n- [x] Core Session architecture (Section 5) - Room/session management defined\r\n- [x] Persona memory isolation (Vault Section 4) - No cross-persona leakage\r\n- [x] UI Component standards (Appendix P) - React components with TypeScript\r\n- [x] Accessibility (Appendix U) - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support\r\n- [x] Expanded Chat spec (Appendix EE) - 4-column layout implemented\r\n\r\n### KISS Compliance\r\n\r\n- [x] Components have single responsibility\r\n- [x] State is lifted to appropriate level (dashboard manages sidebar state)\r\n- [x] Portal used for overlay instead of complex z-index management\r\n- [ ] Visual verification of all states pending\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_This document is the source of truth for current system state. Update after each significant change._\r\n"}}

The goal of Sprints 5 & 6 is to hide the complexity we've built, exposing only what is necessary for the user's immediate executive function.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## dY\". Sprint 5: \"Less is More\" (Structural Integrity)\r\n\r\n**Theme:** Pruning noise and enforcing the \"Single Glass\" philosophy.\r\n\r\n### 1. Metric Pruning (The \"Anti-Brag\" Pass)\r\n\r\n- **Objective:** Remove vanity metrics that increase cognitive load without offering decision value.\r\n- **Actions:**\r\n  - [x] **Sentry**: Removed \"Edit Mode\" from Events/Reports.\r\n  - [ ] **Sentry**: Remove \"Total Events\" counter; Replace with \"System Status: Healthy/Attention\".\r\n  - [ ] **Alden**: Remove \"Total Tasks\" / \"Tasks Completed All Time\". Replace with \"Due Today\" / \"Focus Tasks\".\r\n  - [ ] **Mimic**: Remove \"Token Usage\" (unless critical). Replace with \"Current Persona\" clarity.\r\n\r\n### 2. Sentry Downgrade\r\n\r\n- **Objective:** Sentry should be a utility, not a \"Command Center\".\r\n- **Actions:**\r\n  - Remove Sentry from the Top-Level Module Navigator (Radial).\r\n  - Move Sentry access to the **Settings Panel** (e.g., \"System & Security\" tab).\r\n  - Simplify the `SentryCommandCenter` into a standard `SettingsView` layout.\r\n\r\n### 3. Component Consolidation (Phase 1: Cards)\r\n\r\n- **Objective:** Reduce visual fragmentation by standardizing on `PremiumCard`.\r\n- **Reference:** `COMPONENT_CONSOLIDATION_ROADMAP.md` (Phase 1)\r\n- **Actions:**\r\n  - Migrate `HearthlinkCard`, `ADHDCard`, `GlassCard` -> `PremiumCard`.\r\n  - Ensure `PremiumCard` supports the \"Zen Mode\" variants required for Sprint 6.\r\n\r\n### 4. Codebase Cleanup (The \"Boy Scout\" Rule)\r\n\r\n- **Actions:**\r\n  - Remove the \"Edit Mode\" toggle logic entirely from Sentry code (it's hidden but the code remains).\r\n  - Delete `src/components/vault/VaultDashboard.legacy.tsx` (confirmed unused).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## dY\u0015~ Sprint 6: \"The ADHD Engine\" (Activation)\r\n\r\n**Theme:** Turning on the specialized accessibility features that differentiate Hearthlink.\r\n\r\n### 1. The \"Focus Assist\" (S.O.S.) Protocol\r\n\r\n- **Objective:** Implement the UX Review recommendation for a global \"Overwhelmed\" button.\r\n- **Actions:**\r\n  - Add a persistent \"Focus Assist\" button to the `UnifiedAppShell`.\r\n  - **Click Behavior:**\r\n    - Hides all non-essential modules.\r\n    - Activates `AliceDeepWorkSession` in a modal overlay.\r\n    - Prompts: \"What is the ONE thing blocking you?\"\r\n\r\n### 2. Activate `ADHDOptimizedInterface`\r\n\r\n- **Objective:** Connect the orphaned `ADHDThemeProvider` to the real app.\r\n- **Actions:**\r\n  - Wrap `UnifiedHearthlinkApp` with `ADHDThemeProvider`.\r\n  - Wire Settings (Reduce Motion, High Contrast) to the provider.\r\n  - modifying `PremiumCard` / `PremiumInput` to consume `useADHDUI` tokens (e.g., removing gloss effects when energy is \"Low\").\r\n\r\n### 3. Backend Optimization\r\n\r\n- **Reference:** `BACKEND_ENGINEER_REVIEW.md`\r\n- **Actions:**\r\n  - **Audit:** Fix 3 critical N+1 query patterns in `calendar.rs` and `tasks.rs`.\r\n  - **Standardize:** Ensure all new commands use the `RequestStruct` pattern.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## dY>瓔,? Regression Guardrails (What NOT to Touch)\r\n\r\n1.  **Vault Encryption**: The Security Review confirmed `AES-256-GCM` is working correctly. Do **NOT** refactor the encryption primitives in `secure_vault.rs` or `memory_slices.rs`.\r\n2.  **IPC Bridge Pattern**: While the Architect noted complexity, the bridges are currently stable. Do **NOT** rewrite the entire IPC layer in these sprints; focus on UI first.\r\n3.  **Database Schema**: Defer major schema migrations (Task unification) until AFTER the UI consolidation is stable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 僶. Definition of Done (End of Sprint 6)\r\n\r\n1.  **Visual Silence**: The dashboard should feel \"empty\" compared to today.\r\n2.  **Sentry is Invisible**: Security monitors run in the background; UI is accessible but hidden.\r\n3.  **Zen Mode works**: Clicking \"Focus Assist\" successfully simplifies the UI state.\r\n4.  **No Dead Code**: Unused \"Brag Metric\" components and Legacy Dashboards are deleted.\r\n"}}

ConsolidatedModuleNavigator\r\n**File**: `src/components/shared/ConsolidatedModuleNavigator.tsx`\r\n\r\n**Features**:\r\n- Combines all functionality from three existing implementations\r\n- Supports three visual styles: `default`, `starcraft`, `mythtech`\r\n- Horizontal and vertical layouts\r\n- Proper accessibility with ARIA attributes\r\n- Persona dropdown support (for Alden module)\r\n- Responsive design\r\n\r\n**Usage**:\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { ModuleNavigator, ModuleName } from '@/components/shared';\r\n\r\n<ModuleNavigator\r\n  currentModule=\"alden\"\r\n  orientation=\"horizontal\"\r\n  style=\"starcraft\"\r\n  onModuleChange={(module) => console.log(module)}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Enhanced LoadingSpinner\r\n**File**: `src/components/shared/LoadingSpinner.tsx`\r\n\r\n**Features**:\r\n- Combines functionality from both existing implementations\r\n- Supports multiple variants: `default`, `mythtech`\r\n- Multiple color options: `cyan`, `violet`, `green`, `current`\r\n- Configurable sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg`\r\n- Optional message display\r\n- Proper accessibility with `role=\"status\"` and `aria-live=\"polite\"`\r\n\r\n**Usage**:\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { LoadingSpinner } from '@/components/shared';\r\n\r\n<LoadingSpinner\r\n  size=\"lg\"\r\n  color=\"cyan\"\r\n  variant=\"mythtech\"\r\n  message=\"Loading data...\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Migration Steps\r\n\r\n### For ModuleNavigator\r\n\r\n1. **Replace imports**:\r\n   ```tsx\r\n   // Old\r\n   import { ModuleNavigator } from '@/components/shared/ModuleNavigator';\r\n   \r\n   // New\r\n   import { ModuleNavigator } from '@/components/shared';\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Update props**:\r\n   - The consolidated component accepts all props from both old implementations\r\n   - Add the `style` prop for visual theme: `default`, `starcraft`, `mythtech`\r\n   - Use `ModuleName` type instead of string for type safety\r\n\r\n3. **Handle persona navigation**:\r\n   - If you were using the complex ModuleNavigator with personas, the consolidated version handles this automatically\r\n   - Personas are only available for the 'alden' module\r\n\r\n### For LoadingSpinner\r\n\r\n1. **Replace imports**:\r\n   ```tsx\r\n   // Old\r\n   import { LoadingSpinner } from '@/components/shared/MythTechUI';\r\n   \r\n   // New\r\n   import { LoadingSpinner } from '@/components/shared';\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Update usage**:\r\n   - Add the `variant` prop if you need Myth-tech styling\r\n   - Use the `color` prop for different color schemes\r\n   - Add the `message` prop for loading text\r\n\r\n## Deprecated Components\r\n\r\nThe following components are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version:\r\n\r\n- `src/components/shared/ModuleNavigator.tsx` (use `ConsolidatedModuleNavigator`)\r\n- `src/components/shared/MythTechNavigation.tsx` (use `ConsolidatedModuleNavigator` with `style=\"mythtech\"`)\r\n- `LoadingSpinner` from `MythTechUI.tsx` (use the standalone `LoadingSpinner`)\r\n\r\n## Benefits of Consolidation\r\n\r\n1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Eliminates duplicate code\r\n2. **Improved Maintainability**: Single source of truth for component logic\r\n3. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Consolidated ARIA implementation\r\n4. **Better Type Safety**: Unified TypeScript interfaces\r\n5. **Consistent Styling**: Multiple visual themes from a single component\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\n- **Phase 1** (Current): Consolidation complete\r\n- **Phase 2** (Next major version): Remove deprecated components\r\n- **Phase 3** (Future): Migrate all consuming components\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nFor questions about migration or to report issues, please refer to the development team or create an issue in the project repository.\r\n"}}
