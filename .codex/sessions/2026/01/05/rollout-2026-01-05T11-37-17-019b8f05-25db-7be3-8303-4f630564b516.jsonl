System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Verified manually. `AuthProvider` correctly managing session state.\r\n- **E2E Validation:** Гs Л,? Partial Pass (Logic verified, UI timeouts in CI).\r\n  - Critical fix: Tutorial Overlay issue resolved.\r\n- **Visual Verification:** Гo. **PASS**.\r\n  - **Aesthetics:** Verified \"MythTech\" (Navy/Cyan/Gold) theme is consistent.\r\n  - **Functionality:** Alden Chat Гo., Vault Search Гo. (Graceful failure without backend).\r\n  - **Radial Menu Routing**: **FIXED**.\r\n    - **Issue:** Synapse, Vault, Sentry, and Mimic modules were redirecting to the launcher instead of their respective pages when navigating via the radial menu.\r\n    - **Resolution:** Identified that `HearthlinkApp.tsx` (the parent component for \"existing\" UI mode) was failing to pass `onNavigateToModule` to these specific module command centers. Added the missing prop propagation.\r\n    - **Verification:** Verified via browser automation that navigation from Mimic -> Synapse -> Vault works correctly and titles display as expected.\r\n  - **Fixes:** Patched `AldenTerminal` runtime error, `UnifiedHearthlinkApp` routing props, and unified `AliceCommandCenter` UI (Header/Sidebar/TZ).\r\n  - **Expanded Chat UI Refinement:** Гo. **VERIFIED**.\r\n    - **Layout:** Active Agent column widened to ~400px.\r\n    - **Header Consistency:** All 4 columns (System, Bridge, Active, Private) fixed to exactly **56px** height.\r\n    - **Active Agent Panel:**\r\n      - **Avatar:** Portrait mode (9:16 aspect ratio) matching design.\r\n      - **Controls:** \"Bridge\" and \"Native\" buttons reduced to small size (w-14, 8px text).\r\n    - **Consistency:** Chat tab verified in all modules.\r\n    - **Fullscreen Height:** Verified 919px height for Chat tab in all modules.\r\n    - **Identity:** Vault Resident AI confirmed as Sentry. Verified headers.\r\n- **Next Steps:** Prepare Release Candidate 1.0.\r\n\r\n- **Core Module Stability:** Гo. **FIXED**.\r\n  - **Issue:** \"Session not loaded\" crash causing navigation loops.\r\n  - **Resolution:** `CoreBridge` now auto-creates sessions or falls back to offline mode.\r\n  - **Visuals:** Fixed Time Zone dropdown contrast and Sidebar visibility (removed dark overlays).\r\n  - **Error Handling:** Suppressed \"No active session\" error on initial load for cleaner UI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Design Philosophy: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)\r\n\r\n> All implementations must prioritize simplicity, clarity, and maintainability over feature complexity.\r\n\r\n### Enforcement Principles\r\n\r\n1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component does ONE thing well\r\n2. **Minimal Props**: Pass only what's needed, derive the rest\r\n3. **Composition over Complexity**: Build complex UIs from simple building blocks\r\n4. **Direct Communication**: Minimize layers of indirection\r\n5. **Readable State**: State should be obvious from component structure\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Universal Chat Architecture\r\n\r\n### Documented Design (Master Doc Section 5 + Appendix EE)\r\n\r\nThe Universal Chat is the **primary user interface for Core Sessions**, enabling:\r\n\r\n- Multi-persona interaction\r\n- Context switching between AI agents\r\n- Future avatar integration\r\n\r\n### Current Implementation Status\r\n\r\n| Component           | Path                                | Status         | KISS Compliant  |\r\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\r\n| `UnifiedChatLayout` | `shared/chat/UnifiedChatLayout.tsx` | Гo.

QA Audit completed (Found Critical Debt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## dY?Ÿ SPRINT 2: VISUALIZATION & CLEANUP (ACTIVE)\r\n\r\n**Focus:** Knowledge Graph (Enhancement) & Accountable Code Cleanup\r\n\r\n- **Goal 2.1 (Enhancement):** Enhance `KnowledgeGraphViewer.tsx`.\r\n  - _Agent:_ **Codex**\r\n  - _Task:_ The viewer exists but is basic. Add **\"Pulse\" animation** to active nodes, **Zoom controls**, and **Export as PNG**. Verify D3 performance with >500 nodes.\r\n- **Goal 2.2 (Cleanup):** Resolve Synapse Compilation Errors.\r\n  - _Agent:_ **Gemini** (Governor's Choice)\r\n  - _Task:_ Fix the TypeScript errors in `SynapseCommandCenter.tsx` that were dismissed in Sprint 1. \"The Boy Scout Rule\" applies.\r\n\r\n- **Goal 2.3 (Refactor):** Begin Unified Header Consolidation.\r\n  - _Agent:_ **Claude**\r\n  - _Task:_ Create a single, canonical `UnifiedCommandCenter.tsx` that supports both \"Full\" and \"Lite\" modes, respecting the 56px height standard. Merge the 3 existing versions.\r\n\r\n- **Goal 2.4 (QA):** Verify Fixes & Graph Performance.\r\n  - _Agent:_ **GLM 4.7**\r\n  - _Task:_ Performance test the new Graph Visualizer with 100+ nodes and verify Synapse builds cleanly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## SPRINT 3: FUNCTIONAL DEPTH (INTERACTIVITY)\r\n\r\n**Focus:** Sentry Edit Mode & Plugins\r\n\r\n- **Goal 3.1 (Sentry):** Enable \"Edit Mode\" in Sentry Dashboard.\r\n  - _Agent:_ Claude\r\n  - _Task:_ Convert Read-Only views to Editable forms/toggles.\r\n- **Goal 3.2 (Synapse):** Build `PluginMarketplace.tsx`.\r\n  - _Agent:_ Gemini 3 Pro\r\n  - _Task:_ Create the \"App Store\" UI for plugins using the MythTech design system.\r\n\r\n## SPRINT 4: ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATIONS\r\n\r\n**Focus:** OAuth2 & Redundancy\r\n\r\n- **Goal 4.1 (Backend):** OAuth2 Scaffolding.\r\n  - _Agent:_ Claude\r\n  - _Task:_ Design the Rust infrastructure for OAuth2 token handling (replacing App Passwords).\r\n- **Goal 4.2 (Refactor):** Component Deduplication.\r\n  - _Agent:_ GLM 4.7\r\n  - _Task:_ Scan for duplicate UI components (e.g., multiple \"Card\" implementations) and propose a consolidation plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n## SPRINT 2 CONSOLIDATION (CONTEXT)\r\n# TRIBUNAL CONSOLIDATION: SPRINT 2 (Visualization & Cleanup)\r\n\r\n**Date:** 2026-01-05\r\n**Status:** SUCCESS\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe **External Parallel** swarm successfully executed Sprint 2. The technical debt from Sprint 1 (Synapse errors, Header redundancy) has been aggressively resolved, and the Knowledge Graph has been enhanced.\r\n\r\nThe \"Boy Scout Rule\" protocol led to a 100% cleanup rate this sprint.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. AGENT DELIVERABLES\r\n\r\n### dY\u000f- AGENT 1 (Codex): Knowledge Graph Enhancement\r\n\r\n- **Status:** ƒsÿ‹,? PARTIAL (Functional but incomplete verification)\r\n- **Deliverables:**\r\n  - `src/components/vault/KnowledgeGraphViewer.tsx`: Added Zoom/Pan, PNG Export, and Pulse animations.\r\n  - Added stress-test presets (750/1000 nodes).\r\n- **Notes:** Did not run a live 500+ node performance check (deferred to manual testing).\r\n\r\n### dY\u000f- AGENT 2 (Gemini): Synapse Cleanup\r\n\r\n- **Status:** ƒo. COMPLETE\r\n- **Deliverables:**\r\n  - `src/components/synapse/SynapseCommandCenter.tsx`: **FULLY FIXED.**\r\n  - Resolved all TS errors that were dismissed in Sprint 1.\r\n  - Fixed `accentColor` type mismatch.\r\n  - Removed all `@ts-ignore` directives.\r\n\r\n### dY\u000f- AGENT 3 (Claude): Header Consolidation\r\n\r\n- **Status:** ƒo. COMPLETE\r\n- **Deliverables:**\r\n  - **Canonical Component:** `src/components/shared/UnifiedCommandCenter.tsx` (56px height).\r\n  - **Backward Compatibility:** Merged 3 versions into 1. Created shims for `Optimized` and `Premium` versions to prevent breaking changes.\r\n  - **Standard Enforced:** All headers are now 56px, resolving the critical design debt.\r\n\r\n### dY\u000f- AGENT 4 (GLM): QA & Performance\r\n\r\n- **Status:** ƒo. COMPLETE\r\n- **Findings:**\r\n  - **Graph Performance:** Infrastructure exists. 50-100 nodes expected to pass. >500 nodes flagged as \"Extreme\" risk.\r\n  - **Build Verification:** Verified Synapse and Header integration.\r\n  - **Debt Assessment:** Confirmed all Sprint 1 Critical Debt items were addressed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3.

COMPLETE\r\n- **Deliverables:**\r\n  - **Vault:** Verified `KnowledgeGraphViewer` <-> `VaultBridge` wiring (No code changes needed).\r\n  - **Synapse:** Created `PluginMarketplace.tsx` and integrated it into `SynapseCommandCenter.tsx`.\r\n- **Outcome:** Vault Graph is ready for Sprint 2 visualization; Synapse has a UI for plugins.\r\n\r\n### dY\u000f- AGENT 4 (GLM): QA Audit\r\n\r\n- **Status:** バ. COMPLETE\r\n- **Findings (Critical):**\r\n  - **Header Chaos:** 3 different `UnifiedCommandCenter` implementations (Normal, Premium, Optimized).\r\n  - **Height Mismatch:** Headers range from 56px to 96px, violating the 56px standard.\r\n  - **Duplication:** Multiple modules have conflicting dashboards (e.g., `AldenDashboard` vs `AldenCommandCenter`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. ACCOUNTABILITY & PROCESS IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Agent 2 (Claude) reported: _\"The TypeScript compilation shows errors in other files (SynapseCommandCenter.tsx and react-router-dom type definitions), but these are NOT related to the changes made... and were ignored.\"_\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** **UNACCEPTABLE.**\r\nWhile \"Not My Code\" is a valid defense for _breaking_ changes, \"Not My Problem\" is not a valid stance for _existing_ errors in a shared codebase.\r\n\r\n### dY+\u0007 PROTOCOL: \"THE BOY SCOUT RULE\" (Leave it Cleaner)\r\n\r\n1.  **Passive Fix:** If an error is trivial (import fix, type casting), **FIX IT**.\r\n2.  **Active Logging:** If an error is complex/out-of-scope, it **MUST** be logged in `.agent/staging/ide_problems.json`.\r\n3.  **Zero Tolerence:** \"Ignored\" is no longer a valid status.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. TECHNICAL DEBT LOG (Sprint 1)\r\n\r\nThe following issues were identified but deferred (Action Items for Sprint 1.5):\r\n\r\n| Component                  | Issue                                       | Severity | Owner      |\r\n| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------- | :--------- |\r\n| `SynapseCommandCenter.tsx` | TS Compilation Errors (dismissed by Claude) | High     | **Gemini** |\r\n| `UnifiedCommandCenter`     | 3 conflicting implementations               | Critical | **GLM**    |\r\n| `Header Heights`           | Inconsistent (56px vs 96px)                 | Medium   | **Codex**  |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. NEXT STEPS (Sprint 2 Prep)\r\n\r\n1.  **Fix the Build:** Immediately investigate and resolve the `SynapseCommandCenter` TS errors.\r\n2.  **Visual Verification:** User to inspect the new Alice and Sentry dashboards.\r\n3.  **Consolidation:** Begin merging the 3 `UnifiedCommandCenter` versions (assigned to GLM findings).\r\n\r\n**Approval to proceed to Sprint 1.5 (Cleanup)?**\r\n"}}
