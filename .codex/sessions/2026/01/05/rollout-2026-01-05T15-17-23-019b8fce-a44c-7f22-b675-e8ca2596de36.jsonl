Each agent has a distinct role and is configured with a specific skill prompt from the `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n## Core Development Team\n\n### 1. Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Failure to do so wastes tokens and creates technical debt.**\r\n\r\n### Phase 1: Existence Check (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nBefore implementing ANY feature, verify it doesn't already exist:\r\n\r\n1. **Search for existing implementations**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check for command handlers\r\n   grep -r \"command_name\" src-tauri/src/\r\n\r\n   # Check for modules\r\n   ls -la src-tauri/src/ | grep feature_name\r\n\r\n   # Check for TypeScript bridges\r\n   grep -r \"feature_name\" src/bridges/\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Check for module directories**\r\n   - Look for `src-tauri/src/feature/` directory structure\r\n   - Directory with `mod.rs` often means comprehensive implementation\r\n   - Standalone `.rs` file might be legacy/stub/wrapper\r\n\r\n3. **Read completion documentation**\r\n   - Check for `docs/03_modules/*/COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` files\r\n   - Look for \"Гo. Phase 1 Complete\" or similar status markers\r\n   - Read `CLAUDE.md` for architecture notes\r\n\r\n4. **Verify what `mod feature;` points to**\r\n   - In Rust: `mod feature;` can point to `feature.rs` OR `feature/mod.rs`\r\n   - Directory takes precedence over file if both exist\r\n   - Check `main.rs` to see what's actually imported\r\n\r\n5. **Check git history for disconnections**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Look for recent \"backup\" commits\r\n   git log --oneline --since=\"1 week ago\" | grep -i backup\r\n\r\n   # Check when feature file was last modified\r\n   git log --oneline -- src-tauri/src/feature.rs\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Phase 2: Problem Diagnosis (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nIf feature \"doesn't work,\" diagnose WHY before implementing:\r\n\r\n**Possible Causes** (check in order):\r\n1. **Wiring Issue** - Implementation exists but not connected to main.rs\r\n2. **Command Naming Mismatch** - TypeScript calls different name than Rust provides\r\n3. **State Not Initialized** - Manager exists but not in Tauri state\r\n4. **Missing Registration** - Command exists but not in invoke_handler\r\n5. **Type Mismatch** - Request struct doesn't match TypeScript expectations\r\n6. **Actual Missing Implementation** - Legitimately doesn't exist (verify first!)\r\n\r\n**Diagnostic Questions to Ask User:**\r\n- \"I found existing implementation in `src-tauri/src/feature/`. Should I connect it or replace it?\"\r\n- \"There's a comprehensive module with X lines of code. Why might it not be in use?\"\r\n- \"Git history shows this was disconnected recently. What happened?\"\r\n\r\n### Phase 3: Estimation Validation (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nBefore estimating implementation work:\r\n\r\n1. **Verify implementation isn't duplicating existing work**\r\n   - Check line counts: `wc -l src-tauri/src/feature/*.rs`\r\n   - Review existing command handlers with `grep \"#\\[tauri::command\\]\"`\r\n   - Look for test files that might document what exists\r\n\r\n2. **Consider \"wiring\" vs \"building\"**\r\n   - **Wiring** (2-4 hours): Connect existing implementation to main.rs\r\n   - **Building** (20-40 hours): Implement from scratch\r\n   - Don't estimate building when wiring is sufficient!\r\n\r\n3. **Check for backup/legacy files**\r\n   - Files named `*_legacy.rs`, `*_old.rs`, `*.bak` indicate refactoring\r\n   - Don't rebuild what exists in a backup - investigate instead\r\n\r\n### Phase 4: Architecture Verification (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nBefore implementing, understand current architecture:\r\n\r\n1. **Module Pattern Check**\r\n   ```rust\r\n   // Single file pattern (simple/legacy)\r\n   mod feature;  // Points to feature.rs\r\n\r\n   // Module directory pattern (comprehensive)\r\n   mod feature;  // Points to feature/mod.rs\r\n   use feature::manager::*;\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **State Management Check**\r\n   - Search for `State<'_, FeatureState>` in existing code\r\n   - Check if managers are initialized in setup hook\r\n   - Verify database connections are passed to managers\r\n\r\n3. **Command Naming Convention Check**\r\n   - Real module might use: `feature_entity_action`\r\n   - TypeScript bridge might call: `feature_action`\r\n   - Need compatibility aliases if mismatch\r\n\r\n### Checklist Summary (Use This Every Time)\r\n\r\n**Before ANY implementation:**\r\n- [ ] Searched codebase for existing implementations\r\n- [ ] Checked for module directories matching feature\r\n- [ ] Read completion/status documentation\r\n- [ ] Verified what `mod feature;` actually imports\r\n- [ ] Checked git history for recent changes/backups\r\n- [ ] Diagnosed WHY feature doesn't work (not just assumed missing)\r\n- [ ] Asked user for clarification if comprehensive implementation exists unused\r\n- [ ] Estimated correctly (wiring vs building from scratch)\r\n- [ ] Understood current architecture pattern\r\n- [ ] Checked for command naming conventions\r\n\r\n**Red Flags (STOP and investigate):**\r\n- Гs Л,? Directory `src-tauri/src/feature/` exists with many files\r\n- Гs Л,? Documentation says \"Гo. Phase 1 Complete\" but user says doesn't work\r\n- Гs Л,? Found file named `*_legacy.rs` or `*_old.rs`\r\n- Гs Л,? Git log shows recent \"backup\" commit\r\n- Гs Л,? Line counts are substantial (>500 lines indicates mature implementation)\r\n- Гs Л,? Manager structs exist (`FeatureManager`, `TaskManager`, etc.)\r\n- Гs Л,? Database schemas exist (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS feature_*`)\r\n\r\n### Example: Correct Verification Flow\r\n\r\n**User says:** \"Calendar doesn't work\"\r\n\r\n**Wrong approach:** \"I'll implement calendar commands\" Г+' Start coding\r\n\r\n**Correct approach:**\r\n1. Search: `grep -r \"calendar\" src-tauri/src/` Г+' Found `alden/calendar.rs`!\r\n2. Check size: `wc -l src-tauri/src/alden/calendar.rs` Г+' 428 lines!\r\n3. Look for commands: `grep \"#\\[tauri::command\\]\" calendar.rs` Г+' Found 6 commands!\r\n4. Check main.rs: No import of `alden::calendar::*` Г+' **This is a wiring issue!**\r\n5. Ask user: \"Found comprehensive calendar implementation. Should I connect it?\"\r\n\r\n**Result:** Wiring fix (2 hours) instead of rebuild (20 hours) Г+' **90% token savings!**\r\n\r\n### Accountability\r\n\r\nThis protocol was established after discovering ~400 lines of redundant calendar implementation were created when a comprehensive 428-line implementation already existed but wasn't connected. The waste: 88K tokens (44% of session budget).\r\n\r\n**This must never happen again.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou are the project planner and technical leader for Hearthlink, ensuring clear requirements, solid technical specifications, effective project management, and successful delivery of an accessible, high-quality AI assistant application. **You must complete the Pre-Implementation Verification Protocol before any feature work.**\r\n"}}
