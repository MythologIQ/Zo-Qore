You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\r\nmetadata:\r\n  short-description: Create or update a skill\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Skill Creator\r\n\r\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\r\n\r\n## About Skills\r\n\r\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\r\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\r\ndomains or tasksâ€”they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\r\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\r\n\r\n### What Skills Provide\r\n\r\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\r\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\r\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\r\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\r\n\r\n## Core Principles\r\n\r\n### Concise is Key\r\n\r\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\r\n\r\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\r\n\r\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\r\n\r\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\r\n\r\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\r\n\r\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\r\n\r\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\r\n\r\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\r\n\r\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\r\n\r\n### Anatomy of a Skill\r\n\r\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\r\n\r\n```\r\nskill-name/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md (required)\r\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\r\nâ”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ name: (required)\r\nâ”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ description: (required)\r\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Markdown instructions (required)\r\nâ””â”€â”€ Bundled Resources (optional)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\r\n    â””â”€â”€ assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### SKILL.md (required)\r\n\r\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\r\n\r\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\r\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\r\n\r\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\r\n\r\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\r\n\r\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\r\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\r\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\r\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\r\n\r\n##### References (`references/`)\r\n\r\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\r\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\r\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\r\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\r\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\r\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skillâ€”this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\r\n\r\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\r\n\r\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\r\n\r\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\r\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\r\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\r\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\r\n\r\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\r\n\r\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\r\n\r\n- README.md\r\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\r\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\r\n- CHANGELOG.md\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\r\n\r\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\r\n\r\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\r\n\r\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\r\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\r\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\r\n\r\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\r\n\r\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\r\n\r\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# PDF Processing\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\r\n[code example]\r\n\r\n## Advanced features\r\n\r\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\r\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\r\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\r\n\r\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbigquery-skill/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\r\nâ””â”€â”€ reference/\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ product.md (API usage, features)\r\n    â””â”€â”€ marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncloud-deploy/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\r\nâ””â”€â”€ references/\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\r\n    â”œâ”€â”€ gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\r\n    â””â”€â”€ azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\r\n\r\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\r\n\r\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# DOCX Processing\r\n\r\n## Creating documents\r\n\r\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\r\n\r\n## Editing documents\r\n\r\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\r\n\r\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\r\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\r\n\r\n**Important guidelines:**\r\n\r\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\r\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\r\n\r\n## Skill Creation Process\r\n\r\nSkill creation involves these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\r\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\r\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\r\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\r\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\r\n6. Iterate based on real usage\r\n\r\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\r\n\r\n### Skill Naming\r\n\r\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\r\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\r\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\r\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\r\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\r\n\r\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\r\n\r\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\r\n\r\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\r\n\r\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\r\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\r\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\r\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\r\n\r\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\r\n\r\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\r\n\r\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\r\n\r\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\r\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\r\n\r\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\r\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\r\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\r\n\r\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\r\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\r\n\r\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\r\n\r\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\r\n\r\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\r\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\r\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script:\r\n\r\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\r\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\r\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\r\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\r\n\r\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\r\n\r\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\r\n\r\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\r\n\r\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\r\n\r\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\r\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\r\n\r\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\r\n\r\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\r\n\r\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\r\n\r\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\r\n\r\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\r\n\r\n#### Update SKILL.md\r\n\r\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\r\n\r\n##### Frontmatter\r\n\r\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\r\n\r\n- `name`: The skill name\r\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\r\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\r\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\r\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\r\n\r\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\r\n\r\n##### Body\r\n\r\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\r\n\r\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\r\n\r\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptional output directory specification:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe packaging script will:\r\n\r\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\r\n\r\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\r\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\r\n   - Description completeness and quality\r\n   - File organization and resource references\r\n\r\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\r\n\r\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\r\n\r\n### Step 6: Iterate\r\n\r\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\r\n\r\n**Iteration workflow:**\r\n\r\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\r\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\r\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\r\n4. Implement changes and test again\r\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Overview\r\n\r\nWhile the creators of Tauri have not released a standalone \"Agent Skill\" file (like a SKILL.md), they have released Tauri 2.0 with deep architectural changes designed for performance and security that serve as the \"official\" blueprint for any AI-driven application.\r\n\r\nThis document breaks down Tauri 2.0 capabilities into 8 distinct skill subsets that can be acquired independently but build upon each other.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Skill 1: Security & Permission Architecture\r\n\r\n### Official Resources\r\n\r\n- **Security Best Practices**: https://v2.tauri.app/security/\r\n- **The Tauri Book**: Authored by Daniel Thompson-Yvetot and Lucas Fernandes GonÃ§alves Nogueira\r\n\r\n### Core Capabilities\r\n\r\n#### Capabilities & ACLs System\r\n\r\nTauri 2.0 introduced a granular Capabilities system that allows you to define exactly which windows have access to specific Rust commands or system resources.\r\n\r\n**Key Features**:\r\n\r\n- Replace legacy `allowlist` with declarative `capabilities`\r\n- Window-level permission scoping\r\n- Fine-grained access control lists (ACLs)\r\n- Permission inheritance and composition\r\n\r\n**Configuration Pattern**:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json\",\r\n  \"identifier\": \"main-capability\",\r\n  \"description\": \"Main window capabilities\",\r\n  \"windows\": [\"main\"],\r\n  \"permissions\": [\r\n    \"core:default\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-start-dragging\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-maximize\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-minimize\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-close\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-hide\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-show\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-focus\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-center\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-resizable\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-title\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-size\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-position\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-always-on-top\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-fullscreen\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-decorations\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-icon\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-set-skip-taskbar\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-request-user-attention\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-print\",\r\n    \"core:app:allow-app-show\",\r\n

\"core:event:allow-emit-to\",\r\n    \"core:event:allow-listen\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-ask\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-confirm\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-message\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-open\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-save\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-read-file\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-write-file\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-read-dir\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-copy-file\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-create-dir\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-remove-dir\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-remove-file\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-rename-file\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-exists\",\r\n    \"fs:scope-app-data\",\r\n    \"fs:scope-app-local-data\",\r\n    \"fs:scope-app-cache\",\r\n    \"fs:scope-app-log\",\r\n    \"http:allow-fetch\",\r\n    \"http:allow-fetch-cancel\",\r\n    \"http:allow-fetch-read-body\",\r\n    \"http:allow-fetch-send\",\r\n    \"shell:allow-execute\",\r\n    \"shell:allow-open\",\r\n    \"shell:allow-kill\",\r\n    \"shell:allow-spawn\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Content Security Policy (CSP)\r\n\r\nOfficial recommendation for webview isolation and security.\r\n\r\n**Pattern**:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"security\": {\r\n    \"csp\": \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' ws: wss: http://localhost:* https://localhost:* https://api.openai.com https://api.anthropic.com; img-src 'self' data: blob:; frame-src 'self'\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Use Cases**:\r\n\r\n- Restricting agent access to filesystem\r\n- Controlling network permissions for LLM API calls\r\n- Limiting shell command execution\r\n- Window-specific permission isolation\r\n\r\n### Skill Dependencies\r\n\r\n- **Prerequisites**: None (Foundation skill)\r\n- **Required by**: All other skills\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Skill 2: State Management & Data Flow\r\n\r\n### Official Resources\r\n\r\n- **Managed State API**: https://v2.tauri.app/develop/features/state/\r\n- **The Tauri Book**: State Management chapter\r\n\r\n### Core Capabilities\r\n\r\n#### Managed State API\r\n\r\nUse the Managed State API (`tauri::State`) to store and share agent context or LLM session data safely between Rust and the frontend.\r\n\r\n**Key Features**:\r\n\r\n- Thread-safe shared state via `Arc<Mutex<T>>`\r\n- Type-safe state injection into commands\r\n- Lifecycle-aware state management\r\n- Multi-window state synchronization\r\n\r\n**Implementation Pattern**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse tauri::State;\r\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\r\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\r\n\r\n// Define your state structure\r\nstruct AgentState {\r\n    sessions: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, LlmSession>>>,\r\n    config: Arc<Mutex<AgentConfig>>,\r\n    metrics: Arc<Mutex<PerformanceMetrics>>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct LlmSession {\r\n    id: String,\r\n    model: String,\r\n    context: Vec<Message>,\r\n    created_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Clone, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]\r\nstruct AgentConfig {\r\n    max_tokens: u32,\r\n    temperature: f32,\r\n    timeout_seconds: u64,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Initialize state in main()\r\n#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]\r\npub fn run() {\r\n    tauri::Builder::default()\r\n        .manage(AgentState {\r\n            sessions: Arc::new(Mutex::new(HashMap::new())),\r\n            config: Arc::new(Mutex::new(AgentConfig {\r\n                max_tokens: 4096,\r\n                temperature: 0.7,\r\n                timeout_seconds: 30,\r\n            })),\r\n            metrics: Arc::new(Mutex::new(PerformanceMetrics::default())),\r\n        })\r\n        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![\r\n            create_session,\r\n            get_session,\r\n            update_session,\r\n            delete_session\r\n        ])\r\n        .run(tauri::generate_context!())\r\n        .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Access state in commands\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn create_session(\r\n    model: String,\r\n    state: State<'_, AgentState>\r\n) -> Result<String, String> {\r\n    let session_id = uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string();\r\n    let session = LlmSession {\r\n        id: session_id.clone(),\r\n        model,\r\n        context: Vec::new(),\r\n        created_at: chrono::Utc::now(),\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    state.sessions.lock()\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to acquire lock: {}\", e))?\r\n        .insert(session_id.clone(), session);\r\n\r\n    Ok(session_id)\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn get_session(\r\n    session_id: String,\r\n    state: State<'_, AgentState>\r\n) -> Result<Option<LlmSession>, String> {\r\n    state.sessions.lock()\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to acquire lock: {}\", e))?\r\n        .get(&session_id)\r\n        .cloned()\r\n        .ok_or_else(|| \"Session not found\".to_string())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Advanced State Patterns\r\n\r\n**Read-Only State Access**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn get_config(\r\n    state: State<'_, AgentState>\r\n) -> Result<AgentConfig, String> {\r\n    let config = state.config.lock()\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to acquire lock: {}\", e))?;\r\n    Ok(config.clone())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**State Updates with Notifications**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn update_config(\r\n    new_config: AgentConfig,\r\n    state: State<'_, AgentState>,\r\n    window: tauri::Window\r\n) -> Result<(), String> {\r\n    *state.config.lock()\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to acquire lock: {}\", e))? = new_config.clone();\r\n\r\n    // Notify frontend of state change\r\n    window.emit(\"config-updated\", new_config)\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to emit event: {}\", e))?;\r\n\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Use Cases**:\r\n\r\n- LLM session management\r\n- Agent memory and context\r\n- User preferences\r\n- Performance metrics tracking\r\n- Multi-window state synchronization\r\n\r\n### Skill Dependencies\r\n\r\n- **Prerequisites**: Skill 1 (Security & Permissions)\r\n- **Required by**: Skill 3 (Async Commands), Skill 4 (Plugin Integration)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Skill 3: Async Command Architecture\r\n\r\n### Official Resources\r\n\r\n- **Async Commands**: https://v2.tauri.app/develop/features/command/\r\n- **Tokio Integration**: https://docs.rs/tokio/\r\n\r\n### Core Capabilities\r\n\r\n#### Async Command Handling\r\n\r\nOfficial Invoke Commands should always be async when dealing with long-running agent tasks to avoid freezing the main thread.\r\n\r\n**Key Features**:\r\n\r\n- Non-blocking command execution\r\n- Proper async/await patterns\r\n- Cancellation and timeout handling\r\n- Background task lifecycle management\r\n\r\n**Implementation Pattern**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse tauri::State;\r\nuse tokio::time::{timeout, Duration};\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn execute_agent_task(\r\n    prompt: String,\r\n    session_id: String,\r\n    state: State<'_, AgentState>,\r\n    window: tauri::Window\r\n) -> Result<String, String> {\r\n    // Emit start event\r\n    window.emit(\"task-started\", session_id.clone())\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to emit event: {}\", e))?;\r\n\r\n    // Long-running async operation with timeout\r\n    let result = timeout(\r\n        Duration::from_secs(30),\r\n        process_llm_request(prompt, session_id, state)\r\n    )\r\n    .await\r\n    .map_err(|_| \"Task timed out after 30 seconds\".to_string())?;\r\n\r\n    // Emit completion event\r\n    window.emit(\"task-completed\", &result)\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to emit event: {}\", e))?;\r\n\r\n    Ok(result)\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync fn process_llm_request(\r\n    prompt: String,\r\n    session_id: String,\r\n    state: State<'_, AgentState>\r\n) -> Result<String, String> {\r\n    // Simulate LLM API call\r\n    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await;\r\n\r\n    // Update session context\r\n    {\r\n        let mut sessions = state.sessions.lock()\r\n            .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to acquire lock: {}\", e))?;\r\n\r\n        if let Some(session) = sessions.get_mut(&session_id) {\r\n            session.context.push(Message {\r\n                role: \"user\".to_string(),\r\n                content: prompt,\r\n                timestamp: chrono::Utc::now(),\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Ok(\"Agent response generated successfully\".to_string())\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Clone, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]\r\nstruct Message {\r\n    role: String,\r\n    content: String,\r\n    timestamp: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Cancellation Handling\r\n\r\n**Cancellation Token Pattern**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken;\r\n\r\nstruct AgentState {\r\n    cancellation_tokens: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, CancellationToken>>>,\r\n    // ... other fields\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn cancel_task(\r\n    session_id: String,\r\n    state: State<'_, AgentState>\r\n) -> Result<(), String> {\r\n    let mut tokens = state.cancellation_tokens.lock()\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to acquire lock: {}\", e))?;\r\n\r\n    if let Some(token) = tokens.remove(&session_id) {\r\n        token.cancel();\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    } else {\r\n        Err(\"No active task for this session\".to_string())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Error Handling in Async Commands\r\n\r\n**Comprehensive Error Pattern**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]\r\nenum AgentError {\r\n    #[error(\"LLM API error: {0}\")]\r\n    LlmApiError(String),\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"Session not found: {0}\")]\r\n    SessionNotFound(String),\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"Timeout exceeded\")]\r\n    Timeout,\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"Permission denied\")]\r\n    PermissionDenied,\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"Internal error: {0}\")]\r\n    Internal(String),\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl From<AgentError> for String {\r\n    fn from(error: AgentError) -> Self {\r\n        error.to_string()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn safe_async_command(\r\n    input: String\r\n) -> Result<String, String> {\r\n    match perform_async_work(input).await {\r\n        Ok(result) => Ok(result),\r\n        Err(AgentError::LlmApiError(msg)) => {\r\n            log::error!(\"LLM API error: {}\", msg);\r\n            Err(format!(\"LLM service unavailable: {}\", msg))\r\n        }\r\n        Err(e) => Err(e.to_string()),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync fn perform_async_work(input: String) -> Result<String, AgentError> {\r\n    // Implementation\r\n    Ok(input)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Use Cases**:\r\n\r\n- LLM inference and generation\r\n- File processing and manipulation\r\n- Network requests to external APIs\r\n- Long-running computations\r\n- Background task management\r\n\r\n### Skill Dependencies\r\n\r\n- **Prerequisites**: Skill 1 (Security), Skill 2 (State Management)\r\n- **Required by**: Skill 4 (Plugins), Skill 5 (Error Handling)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Skill 4: Plugin Integration\r\n\r\n### Official Resources\r\n\r\n- **Plugin System**: https://v2.tauri.app/develop/plugins/\r\n- **Official Plugins**: https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/\r\n\r\n### Core Capabilities\r\n\r\n#### Official Plugin System\r\n\r\nThe creators recommend using Official Plugins for common agent tools rather than writing custom

2.0\r\n\r\n### Current State Analysis\r\n\r\n**Hearthlink currently uses Tauri 1.5**:\r\n\r\n- [`Cargo.toml:27`](src-tauri/Cargo.toml:27): `tauri = { version = \"1.5\", ... }`\r\n- [`tauri.conf.json:2`](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:2): Schema version 1\r\n- [`tauri.conf.json:15`](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:15): Legacy `allowlist` system\r\n\r\n### Migration Steps\r\n\r\n#### 1. Update Dependencies\r\n\r\n**Cargo.toml**:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[dependencies]\r\ntauri = { version = \"2.0\", features = [\r\n  \"dialog-ask\", \"dialog-confirm\", \"dialog-message\", \"dialog-open\", \"dialog-save\",\r\n  \"fs-all\", \"http-all\", \"shell-open\", \"window-all\", \"system-tray\"\r\n] }\r\n\r\n# Add official plugins\r\ntauri-plugin-fs = \"2\"\r\ntauri-plugin-shell = \"2\"\r\ntauri-plugin-http = \"2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2. Migrate Configuration\r\n\r\n**Create capabilities directory**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc-tauri/capabilities/\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ main.json\r\nâ”œâ”€â”€ agent-tools.json\r\nâ””â”€â”€ filesystem.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n**main.json**:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json\",\r\n  \"identifier\": \"main-capability\",\r\n  \"windows\": [\"main\"],\r\n  \"permissions\": [\r\n    \"core:default\",\r\n    \"core:window:allow-start-dragging\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-ask\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-confirm\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-message\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-open\",\r\n    \"dialog:allow-save\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**agent-tools.json**:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json\",\r\n  \"identifier\": \"agent-tools-capability\",\r\n  \"windows\": [\"main\"],\r\n  \"permissions\": [\r\n    \"shell:allow-execute\",\r\n    \"shell:allow-open\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-read-file\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-write-file\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-create-dir\",\r\n    \"fs:allow-exists\",\r\n    \"http:allow-fetch\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update tauri.conf.json**:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"https://schema.tauri.app/config/2\",\r\n  \"build\": {\r\n    \"beforeBuildCommand\": \"npm run build\",\r\n    \"beforeDevCommand\": \"npm run dev:react\",\r\n    \"devPath\": \"http://localhost:3005\",\r\n    \"distDir\": \"../build\",\r\n    \"withGlobalTauri\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"bundle\": {\r\n    \"active\": true,\r\n    \"targets\": \"all\",\r\n    \"identifier\": \"com.hearthlink.native\",\r\n    \"publisher\": \"Hearthlink Development Team\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"app\": {\r\n    \"withGlobalTauri\": true,\r\n    \"windows\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"label\": \"main\",\r\n        \"title\": \"Hearthlink - AI Orchestration System\",\r\n        \"width\": 1400,\r\n        \"height\": 900,\r\n        \"minWidth\": 1280,\r\n        \"minHeight\": 800,\r\n        \"center\": true,\r\n        \"resizable\": true,\r\n        \"decorations\": true,\r\n        \"alwaysOnTop\": false,\r\n        \"skipTaskbar\": false,\r\n        \"fullscreen\": false,\r\n        \"transparent\": false,\r\n        \"maximized\": false,\r\n        \"visible\": true,\r\n        \"focus\": true\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"security\": {\r\n      \"csp\": \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' ws: wss: http://localhost:* https://localhost:* https://api.openai.com https://api.anthropic.com; img-src 'self' data: blob:; frame-src 'self'\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Update Rust Code\r\n\r\n**main.rs** - Register plugins:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    tauri::Builder::default()\r\n        .plugin(tauri_plugin_fs::init())\r\n        .plugin(tauri_plugin_shell::init())\r\n        .plugin(tauri_plugin_http::init())\r\n        .manage(AgentState::new())\r\n        .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![\r\n            create_session,\r\n            get_session,\r\n            execute_agent_task\r\n        ])\r\n        .run(tauri::generate_context!())\r\n        .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 4. Frontend API Changes\r\n\r\n**Tauri 2.0 uses different imports**:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Tauri 1.5\r\nimport { invoke } from \"@tauri-apps/api/tauri\";\r\nimport { open } from \"@tauri-apps/api/dialog\";\r\nimport { readTextFile } from \"@tauri-apps/api/fs\";\r\n\r\n// Tauri 2.0\r\nimport { invoke } from \"@tauri-apps/api/core\";\r\nimport { open } from \"@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog\";\r\nimport { readTextFile } from \"@tauri-apps/plugin-fs\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 5. Test Migration\r\n\r\n**Run comprehensive tests**:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Update tests\r\ncargo test --all\r\n\r\n# Build and run\r\nnpm run tauri dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n### Official Documentation\r\n\r\n- **Tauri 2.0 Security**: https://v2.tauri.app/security/\r\n- **Tauri 2.0 Guides**: https://v2.tauri.app/develop/\r\n- **Tauri Book**: https://tauri.app/v1/guides/\r\n- **API Reference**: https://docs.rs/tauri/\r\n\r\n### Community Resources\r\n\r\n- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/tauri\r\n- **GitHub Discussions**: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/discussions\r\n- **Stack Overflow**: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tauri\r\n\r\n### Plugin Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- **Official Plugins**: https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/\r\n- **Community Plugins**: https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis skills documentation provides a comprehensive breakdown of Tauri 2.0 capabilities into 8 distinct, learnable skill subsets. Each skill builds upon the previous ones, creating a clear path from foundation to production readiness.\r\n\r\nFor Hearthlink specifically:\r\n\r\n- **Immediate Focus**: Skills 1-3 (Security, State, Async) - already well-implemented\r\n- **Short-term**: Skills 4-5 (Plugins, Error Handling) - enhance with official plugins\r\n- **Long-term**: Skills 6-8 (Performance, Testing, CI/CD) - production optimization\r\n\r\nThe migration from Tauri 1.5 to 2.0 is significant but well-documented. The skills outlined here provide a roadmap for both learning Tauri 2.0 and applying it to the Hearthlink codebase.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Document Version**: 1.0  \r\n**Last Updated**: 2025-01-31  \r\n**Maintained By**: Hearthlink Development Team  \r\n**Source**: https://v2.tauri.app/security/\r\n"}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- frontend-bridge-integration: Frontend bridge integration for Hearthlink. Use when wiring React/TypeScript bridges to Tauri commands, aligning IPC payload shapes, and updating UI consumers of bridge props. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/frontend-bridge-integration/SKILL.md)\n- marketplace-plugin-ops: Marketplace and plugin operations for Hearthlink. Use when editing marketplace catalog parsing, install/uninstall flows, local plugin scanning, or the marketplace UI/bridge. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/marketplace-plugin-ops/SKILL.md)\n- playwright-e2e-mocks: Playwright E2E authoring and Tauri mock reliability for Hearthlink. Use when updating tests, selectors, or IPC mocks under tests/e2e. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/playwright-e2e-mocks/SKILL.md)\n- security-permission-audit: Security and permissions auditing for Hearthlink. Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules.

Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.\r\n- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.\r\n"}}

Use when adding consent checks, auth guards, audit logging, or SecureVault interactions for Tauri commands. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/security-permission-audit/SKILL.md)\n- skill-lifecycle-ops: Synapse skill lifecycle operations for Hearthlink. Use when working on skill registry, resolution, instance management, execution, or related UI and tests. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/skill-lifecycle-ops/SKILL.md)\n- tauri-ipc-wiring: Tauri Rust IPC command wiring for Hearthlink. Use when adding or changing Tauri commands, invoke handler registration, AuthenticatedRequest payload shapes, or state management in src-tauri. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/tauri-ipc-wiring/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-composition-patterns: React composition patterns that scale. Use when refactoring components with boolean prop proliferation, building flexible component libraries, or designing reusable APIs. Triggers on tasks involving compound components, render props, context providers, or component architecture. Includes React 19 API changes. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/composition-patterns/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-best-practices: React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. This skill should be used when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-best-practices/SKILL.md)\n- vercel-react-native-skills: React Native and Expo best practices for building performant mobile apps. Use when building React Native components, optimizing list performance, implementing animations, or working with native modules. Triggers on tasks involving React Native, Expo, mobile performance, or native platform APIs. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/react-native-skills/SKILL.md)\n- web-design-guidelines: Review UI code for Web Interface Guidelines compliance. Use when asked to \"review my UI\", \"check accessibility\", \"audit design\", \"review UX\", or \"check my site against best practices\". (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
