Purpose\\nDefine a unified Skill System across the four persona modules (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry), a marketplace for trusted skills, and a Core module process standardization layer that prevents drift across agent interactions within a project.\\n\\n## 2. Goals\\n- Provide a consistent skill model that works across all personas and custom agents.\\n- Allow users to assign and override skills per persona or per agent.\\n- Support native skills and downloadable skills from trusted repositories.\\n- Enable skill suggestions based on persona characteristics and user requests.\\n- In Core, standardize skills as a project process to avoid interaction drift.\\n\\n## 3. Non-Goals\\n- Building the actual marketplace UI or download infrastructure in this PRD.\\n- Defining a single “best” persona configuration; user override is always respected.\\n- Replacing persona identity; skills augment behavior, they do not redefine persona.\\n\\n## 4. Definitions\\n- Skill: A packaged capability with instructions, triggers, and constraints.\\n- Native skill: Bundled with the product and maintained internally.\\n- External skill: Downloaded from a trusted repository or marketplace.\\n- Persona module: Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry.\\n- Core process: The standardized skill policy for a project.\\n- Trusted repository: A curated or verified source of skills.\\n\\n## 5. Personas and Skill Scope\\n### 5.1 Alden (Generalist/Operations)\\n- Default domain: Broad operational, project coordination, general planning.\\n- Allowed skills: General purpose, project planning, workflow optimization, documentation.\\n- Suggested skills: Issue triage, release planning, incident review, doc authoring.\\n\\n### 5.2 Alice (Behavioral)\\n- Default domain: Behavioral insights, communication, team dynamics, coaching.\\n- Allowed skills: Behavioral analysis, facilitation, conflict resolution, writing tone guidance.\\n- Suggested skills: Communication tuning, user interview synthesis, sentiment review.\\n\\n### 5.3 Mimic (Marketplace/Creator)\\n- Default domain: Multi-persona orchestration, custom agent creation, skill discovery.\\n- Allowed skills: Full catalog access, including experimental if user enables.\\n- Suggested skills: Skill discovery, persona templating, custom agent builder.\\n\\n### 5.4 Sentry (Security)\\n- Default domain: Security, compliance, risk, policy enforcement.\\n- Allowed skills: Security-relevant only (e.g., threat modeling, secure coding checks, privacy).\\n- Suggested skills: Security baseline checks, compliance mapping, policy verification.\\n- Explicit restriction: Non-security skills should be excluded by default.\\n\\n## 6. User Overrides\\n- Users can override persona defaults per agent or per session.\\n- Overrides are explicit, versioned, and auditable.\\n- Overrides can widen or narrow allowed skill scopes.\\n\\n## 7. Skill Model\\n### 7.1 Skill Manifest (Required Fields)\\n- id: Unique skill identifier.\\n- name: Human-friendly name.\\n- version: SemVer.\\n- description: Short summary.\\n- persona_scope: Allowed personas (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry).\\n- domain_tags: e.g., security, behavioral, devops.\\n- trust_level: native, verified, community.\\n- source: repository or marketplace reference.\\n- triggers: Conditions that suggest or activate skill.\\n- constraints: Hard limits (e.g., no network, restricted tools).\\n- inputs/outputs: Inputs required and outputs produced.\\n\\n### 7.2 Skill Lifecycle\\n- Install (native or external).\\n- Enable per persona or per agent.\\n- Assign per project (Core process).\\n- Audit and update with version pinning.\\n\\n## 8. Skill Assignment\\n### 8.1 Persona Defaults\\n- Each persona has a default allowed skill set.\\n- Sentry default set is restricted to security domains only.\\n- Mimic default set is broad and can include experimental if user allows.\\n\\n### 8.2 Agent-Specific Assignment\\n- Custom agents can be created with specific skill bundles.\\n- Agent bundles inherit persona defaults and apply overrides.\\n\\n### 8.3 Project-Level Assignment (Core)\\n- Project skill profile defines mandatory and optional skills.\\n- Skills are standardized as process; all agents in a project must align.\\n- Version pinning required to prevent drift between agents.\\n\\n## 9. Skill Suggestions\\n- Suggestions based on:\\n  - Persona domain.\\n  - User request keywords.\\n  - Project context (Core process profile).\\n- Suggestions are non-binding and presented with rationale.\\n- Users can approve or dismiss suggestions.\\n\\n## 10. Marketplace and Repositories\\n### 10.1 Trusted Sources\\n- Curated marketplace (first-party and vetted third-party).\\n- Verified external repositories.\\n- Signature validation required for external skills.\\n\\n### 10.2 Marketplace Features\\n- Search by persona, domain, trust level, compatibility.\\n- Version history and changelog.\\n- Trust and security badges.\\n\\n### 10.3 Mimic Marketplace Role\\n- Mimic is the primary UX for skill discovery, installation, and custom agent assembly.\\n- Mimic supports multi-persona bundling and skill package templates.\\n\\n## 11. Core Module Process Standardization\\n### 11.1 Rationale\\n- Multi-agent collaboration risks drift if skills differ.\\n- Core project process standardizes skills to ensure consistency.\\n\\n### 11.2 Process Profile\\n- A project process profile defines:\\n  - Mandatory skills for all agents.\\n  - Optional skills per persona.\\n  - Allowed skill versions.\\n  - Audit requirements.\\n\\n### 11.3 Enforcement\\n- Agents must align with project process profile when operating in project scope.\\n- Mismatched skills trigger warnings and remediation prompts.\\n- Overrides require explicit approval and audit trail.\\n\\n## 12. Governance and Auditing\\n- Log skill changes, overrides, and versions per project.\\n- Track source and trust level for all skills in use.\\n- Allow security review (especially for Sentry).\\n\\n## 13. UX Expectations\\n- Clear skill assignment UI per persona and agent.\\n- Suggestions presented contextually.\\n- Marketplace actions are explicit and reversible.\\n- Core process profile visible in project settings.\\n\\n## 14. Example User Flows\\n### 14.1 User Assigns Skills in Mimic\\n1) User selects Mimic.\\n2) Searches marketplace for “communication synthesis.”\\n3) Installs and assigns to a new custom agent.\\n4) Agent inherits default skills plus user overrides.\\n\\n### 14.2 Security Constraint in Sentry\\n1) User attempts to assign non-security skill.\\n2) System blocks by default, offers override with warning.\\n3) Override is logged and scoped to session or project.\\n\\n### 14.3 Core Project Alignment\\n1) User defines project process profile in Core.\\n2) Agents entering project are checked for skill alignment.\\n3) Non-aligned skills are disabled or updated to match versions.\\n\\n## 15. Open Questions\\n- What is the initial curated list of native skills per persona?\\n- Which repositories are considered trusted at launch?\\n- How granular should persona-to-skill constraints be (tag-based vs explicit allowlists)?\\n- What is the fallback if a required skill is unavailable?\\n'@ | Set-Content -Path docs/SKILL_SYSTEM_PRD.md -Encoding ASCII\"}","call_id":"call_EOVEq5Z4VpCb3dyPW0VsYohr"}}

It focuses on architecture and integration points, not product requirements.\\n\\n## Architecture Goals\\n- Unified skill model that works across all persona modules.\\n- Persona-scoped defaults and restrictions, with user overrides.\\n- Skill discovery, installation, and assignment flows through Mimic.\\n- Core project process profile enforces alignment to prevent drift.\\n- Auditable skill lifecycle and version pinning.\\n\\n## Shared Skill Platform (All Modules)\\n### Components\\n- Skill Registry: Local index of installed skills (native + external).\\n- Skill Resolver: Matches skills to persona, agent, and project constraints.\\n- Skill Executor: Runs skill instructions using allowed tools and constraints.\\n- Skill Audit Log: Tracks installs, overrides, versions, and enforcement.\\n\\n### Data Model\\n- Skill Manifest: id, name, version, description, persona_scope, domain_tags, trust_level, source, triggers, constraints, inputs, outputs.\\n- Agent Skill Profile: persona defaults + agent overrides + project alignment.\\n- Project Process Profile (Core): mandatory skills, optional skills, pinned versions, allowed trust levels.\\n\\n### Core Flows\\n- Install/Update: Resolve skill package, verify trust, store manifest, index in registry.\\n- Assign: Apply persona defaults, agent overrides, and project constraints.\\n- Execute: Validate constraints, run skill through executor, log usage.\\n- Audit: Persist all changes and relevant events to audit log.\\n\\n## Persona Modules\\n\\n### Alden\\n- Integration: Uses shared registry and resolver for general-purpose skills.\\n- Defaults: Operations, planning, documentation, release, incident workflows.\\n- Overrides: User can attach specialist skills for the session or agent.\\n- UI: Skill panel for enabling/disabling, with suggestions based on request.\\n\\n### Alice\\n- Integration: Uses shared registry and resolver with behavioral domain filters.\\n- Defaults: Facilitation, behavioral analysis, communication synthesis.\\n- Constraints: Guardrails on non-behavioral domains unless user overrides.\\n- UI: Suggested skills derived from conversational cues and goals.\\n\\n### Mimic\\n- Integration: Full access to registry, installer, and marketplace adapters.\\n- Primary role: Skill discovery, curation, and custom agent construction.\\n- Features: Persona templates, skill bundles, install/enable flows.\\n- UI: Marketplace search, trust filters, install/assign wizard.\\n\\n### Sentry\\n- Integration: Resolver enforces security-only domain by default.\\n- Defaults: Threat modeling, compliance checks, security review.\\n- Constraints: Non-security skills blocked unless explicit override.\\n- UI: Security badge and policy messaging for overrides.\\n\\n## Core Module (Process Standardization)\\n### Project Process Profile\\n- Defines mandatory skills across all agents on a project.\\n- Sets allowed skill versions and trust levels to avoid drift.\\n- Applies to all personas participating in the project.\\n\\n### Enforcement Pipeline\\n- On project entry: Validate agent skill profile vs project profile.\\n- On mismatch: Warn, disable noncompliant skills, or prompt for alignment.\\n- On override: Require explicit approval and log in audit trail.\\n\\n### Drift Prevention\\n- Version pinning required for project-mandated skills.\\n- Resolver rejects skills outside pinned version or trust levels.\\n- Agents switching personas in-project must remain aligned.\\n\\n## Skill Suggestions\\n- Suggestor service uses persona scope, user request, and project context.\\n- Suggestions are ranked and include rationale.\\n- Users can accept, ignore, or permanently dismiss.\\n\\n## Marketplace and Repositories\\n- Mimic uses Marketplace Adapter to fetch, verify, and install skills.\\n- Signature verification required for external skills.\\n- Trust tiers: native, verified, community, with configurable allowlist.\\n\\n## Integration Points\\n- UI modules call into shared Skill Registry and Resolver.\\n- Executor exposes a consistent API for running skills.\\n- Audit log accessible to Core and Sentry for compliance review.\\n\\n## Rollout Phases\\n1) Build shared registry + manifest schema.\\n2) Integrate persona defaults and UI toggles in Alden/Alice/Sentry.\\n3) Implement Mimic marketplace and custom agent workflow.\\n4) Add Core project profile enforcement and drift controls.\\n'@ | Set-Content -Path docs/SKILL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md -Encoding ASCII\"}","call_id":"call_uvnLU34N7p7Ow5hY4RBFAwGj"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Purpose\r\nDefine a unified Skill System across the four persona modules (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry), a marketplace for trusted skills, and a Core module process standardization layer that prevents drift across agent interactions within a project.\r\n\r\n## 2. Goals\r\n- Provide a consistent skill model that works across all personas and custom agents.\r\n- Allow users to assign and override skills per persona or per agent.\r\n- Support native skills and downloadable skills from trusted repositories.\r\n- Enable skill suggestions based on persona characteristics and user requests.\r\n- In Core, standardize skills as a project process to avoid interaction drift.\r\n\r\n## 3. Non-Goals\r\n- Building the actual marketplace UI or download infrastructure in this PRD.\r\n- Defining a single ?best? persona configuration; user override is always respected.\r\n- Replacing persona identity; skills augment behavior, they do not redefine persona.\r\n\r\n## 4. Definitions\r\n- Skill: A packaged capability with instructions, triggers, and constraints.\r\n- Native skill: Bundled with the product and maintained internally.\r\n- External skill: Downloaded from a trusted repository or marketplace.\r\n- Persona module: Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry.\r\n- Core process: The standardized skill policy for a project.\r\n- Trusted repository: A curated or verified source of skills.\r\n\r\n## 5. Personas and Skill Scope\r\n### 5.1 Alden (Generalist/Operations)\r\n- Default domain: Broad operational, project coordination, general planning.\r\n- Allowed skills: General purpose, project planning, workflow optimization, documentation.\r\n- Suggested skills: Issue triage, release planning, incident review, doc authoring.\r\n\r\n### 5.2 Alice (Behavioral)\r\n- Default domain: Behavioral insights, communication, team dynamics, coaching.\r\n- Allowed skills: Behavioral analysis, facilitation, conflict resolution, writing tone guidance.\r\n- Suggested skills: Communication tuning, user interview synthesis, sentiment review.\r\n\r\n### 5.3 Mimic (Marketplace/Creator)\r\n- Default domain: Multi-persona orchestration, custom agent creation, skill discovery.\r\n- Allowed skills: Full catalog access, including experimental if user enables.\r\n- Suggested skills: Skill discovery, persona templating, custom agent builder.\r\n\r\n### 5.4 Sentry (Security)\r\n- Default domain: Security, compliance, risk, policy enforcement.\r\n- Allowed skills: Security-relevant only (e.g., threat modeling, secure coding checks, privacy).\r\n- Suggested skills: Security baseline checks, compliance mapping, policy verification.\r\n- Explicit restriction: Non-security skills should be excluded by default.\r\n\r\n## 6. User Overrides\r\n- Users can override persona defaults per agent or per session.\r\n- Overrides are explicit, versioned, and auditable.\r\n- Overrides can widen or narrow allowed skill scopes.\r\n\r\n## 7. Skill Model\r\n### 7.1 Skill Manifest (Required Fields)\r\n- id: Unique skill identifier.\r\n- name: Human-friendly name.\r\n- version: SemVer.\r\n- description: Short summary.\r\n- persona_scope: Allowed personas (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry).\r\n- domain_tags: e.g., security, behavioral, devops.\r\n- trust_level: native, verified, community.\r\n- source: repository or marketplace reference.\r\n- triggers: Conditions that suggest or activate skill.\r\n- constraints: Hard limits (e.g., no network, restricted tools).\r\n- inputs/outputs: Inputs required and outputs produced.\r\n\r\n### 7.2 Skill Lifecycle\r\n- Install (native or external).\r\n- Enable per persona or per agent.\r\n- Assign per project (Core process).\r\n- Audit and update with version pinning.\r\n\r\n## 8. Skill Assignment\r\n### 8.1 Persona Defaults\r\n- Each persona has a default allowed skill set.\r\n- Sentry default set is restricted to security domains only.\r\n- Mimic default set is broad and can include experimental if user allows.\r\n\r\n### 8.2 Agent-Specific Assignment\r\n- Custom agents can be created with specific skill bundles.\r\n- Agent bundles inherit persona defaults and apply overrides.\r\n\r\n### 8.3 Project-Level Assignment (Core)\r\n- Project skill profile defines mandatory and optional skills.\r\n- Skills are standardized as process; all agents in a project must align.\r\n- Version pinning required to prevent drift between agents.\r\n\r\n## 9. Skill Suggestions\r\n- Suggestions based on:\r\n  - Persona domain.\r\n  - User request keywords.\r\n  - Project context (Core process profile).\r\n- Suggestions are non-binding and presented with rationale.\r\n- Users can approve or dismiss suggestions.\r\n\r\n## 10. Marketplace and Repositories\r\n### 10.1 Trusted Sources\r\n- Curated marketplace (first-party and vetted third-party).\r\n- Verified external repositories.\r\n- Signature validation required for external skills.\r\n\r\n### 10.2 Marketplace Features\r\n- Search by persona, domain, trust level, compatibility.\r\n- Version history and changelog.\r\n- Trust and security badges.\r\n\r\n### 10.3 Mimic Marketplace Role\r\n- Mimic is the primary UX for skill discovery, installation, and custom agent assembly.\r\n- Mimic supports multi-persona bundling and skill package templates.\r\n\r\n## 11. Core Module Process Standardization\r\n### 11.1 Rationale\r\n- Multi-agent collaboration risks drift if skills differ.\r\n- Core project process standardizes skills to ensure consistency.\r\n\r\n### 11.2 Process Profile\r\n- A project process profile defines:\r\n  - Mandatory skills for all agents.\r\n  - Optional skills per persona.\r\n  - Allowed skill versions.\r\n  - Audit requirements.\r\n\r\n### 11.3 Enforcement\r\n- Agents must align with project process profile when operating in project scope.\r\n- Mismatched skills trigger warnings and remediation prompts.\r\n- Overrides require explicit approval and audit trail.\r\n\r\n## 12. Governance and Auditing\r\n- Log skill changes, overrides, and versions per project.\r\n- Track source and trust level for all skills in use.\r\n- Allow security review (especially for Sentry).\r\n\r\n## 13. UX Expectations\r\n- Clear skill assignment UI per persona and agent.\r\n- Suggestions presented contextually.\r\n- Marketplace actions are explicit and reversible.\r\n- Core process profile visible in project settings.\r\n\r\n## 14. Example User Flows\r\n### 14.1 User Assigns Skills in Mimic\r\n1) User selects Mimic.\r\n2) Searches marketplace for ?communication synthesis.?\r\n3) Installs and assigns to a new custom agent.\r\n4) Agent inherits default skills plus user overrides.\r\n\r\n### 14.2 Security Constraint in Sentry\r\n1) User attempts to assign non-security skill.\r\n2) System blocks by default, offers override with warning.\r\n3) Override is logged and scoped to session or project.\r\n\r\n### 14.3 Core Project Alignment\r\n1) User defines project process profile in Core.\r\n2) Agents entering project are checked for skill alignment.\r\n3) Non-aligned skills are disabled or updated to match versions.\r\n\r\n## 15. Open Questions\r\n- What is the initial curated list of native skills per persona?\r\n- Which repositories are considered trusted at launch?\r\n- How granular should persona-to-skill constraints be (tag-based vs explicit allowlists)?\r\n- What is the fallback if a required skill is unavailable?\r\n# Skill System Architecture\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis document describes the planned implementation of the Skill System across the four persona modules (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry) and the Core module process standardization layer. It focuses on architecture and integration points, not product requirements.\r\n\r\n## Architecture Goals\r\n- Unified skill model that works across all persona modules.\r\n- Persona-scoped defaults and restrictions, with user overrides.\r\n- Skill discovery, installation, and assignment flows through Mimic.\r\n- Core project process profile enforces alignment to prevent drift.\r\n- Auditable skill lifecycle and version pinning.\r\n\r\n## Shared Skill Platform (All Modules)\r\n### Components\r\n- Skill Registry: Local index of installed skills (native + external).\r\n- Skill Resolver: Matches skills to persona, agent, and project constraints.\r\n- Skill Executor: Runs skill instructions using allowed tools and constraints.\r\n- Skill Audit Log: Tracks installs, overrides, versions, and enforcement.\r\n\r\n### Data Model\r\n- Skill Manifest: id, name, version, description, persona_scope, domain_tags, trust_level, source, triggers, constraints, inputs, outputs.\r\n- Agent Skill Profile: persona defaults + agent overrides + project alignment.\r\n- Project Process Profile (Core): mandatory skills, optional skills, pinned versions, allowed trust levels.\r\n\r\n### Core Flows\r\n- Install/Update: Resolve skill package, verify trust, store manifest, index in registry.\r\n- Assign: Apply persona defaults, agent overrides, and project constraints.\r\n- Execute: Validate constraints, run skill through executor, log usage.\r\n- Audit: Persist all changes and relevant events to audit log.\r\n\r\n## Persona Modules\r\n\r\n### Alden\r\n- Integration: Uses shared registry and resolver for general-purpose skills.\r\n- Defaults: Operations, planning, documentation, release, incident workflows.\r\n- Overrides: User can attach specialist skills for the session or agent.\r\n- UI: Skill panel for enabling/disabling, with suggestions based on request.\r\n\r\n### Alice\r\n- Integration: Uses shared registry and resolver with behavioral domain filters.\r\n- Defaults: Facilitation, behavioral analysis, communication synthesis.\r\n- Constraints: Guardrails on non-behavioral domains unless user overrides.\r\n- UI: Suggested skills derived from conversational cues and goals.\r\n\r\n### Mimic\r\n- Integration: Full access to registry, installer, and marketplace adapters.\r\n- Primary role: Skill discovery, curation, and custom agent construction.\r\n- Features: Persona templates, skill bundles, install/enable flows.\r\n- UI: Marketplace search, trust filters, install/assign wizard.\r\n\r\n### Sentry\r\n- Integration: Resolver enforces security-only domain by default.\r\n- Defaults: Threat modeling, compliance checks, security review.\r\n- Constraints: Non-security skills blocked unless explicit override.\r\n- UI: Security badge and policy messaging for overrides.\r\n\r\n## Core Module (Process Standardization)\r\n### Project Process Profile\r\n- Defines mandatory skills across all agents on a project.\r\n- Sets allowed skill versions and trust levels to avoid drift.\r\n- Applies to all personas participating in the project.\r\n\r\n### Enforcement Pipeline\r\n- On project entry: Validate agent skill profile vs project profile.\r\n- On mismatch: Warn, disable noncompliant skills, or prompt for alignment.\r\n- On override: Require explicit approval and log in audit trail.\r\n\r\n### Drift Prevention\r\n- Version pinning required for project-mandated skills.\r\n- Resolver rejects skills outside pinned version or trust levels.\r\n- Agents switching personas in-project must remain aligned.\r\n\r\n## Skill Suggestions\r\n- Suggestor service uses persona scope, user request, and project context.\r\n- Suggestions are ranked and include rationale.\r\n- Users can accept, ignore, or permanently dismiss.\r\n\r\n## Marketplace and Repositories\r\n- Mimic uses Marketplace Adapter to fetch, verify, and install skills.\r\n- Signature verification required for external skills.\r\n- Trust tiers: native, verified, community, with configurable allowlist.\r\n\r\n## Integration Points\r\n- UI modules call into shared Skill Registry and Resolver.\r\n- Executor exposes a consistent API for running skills.\r\n- Audit log accessible to Core and Sentry for compliance review.\r\n\r\n## Component APIs and Interfaces\r\n### Skill Registry\r\n- `registerSkill(manifest)` -> Stores or updates skill metadata and indexes it by id/version.\r\n- `listSkills(filters)` -> Returns skills by persona_scope, domain_tags, trust_level, version.\r\n- `getSkill(id, version)` -> Returns a specific manifest or latest allowed version.\r\n\r\n### Skill Resolver\r\n- `resolvePersonaSkills(persona, context)` -> Persona defaults + overrides + project constraints.\r\n- `resolveAgentSkills(agentId, context)` -> Agent profile derived from persona + agent overrides.\r\n- `validateSkillSet(skillSet, projectProfile)` -> Returns compliance status + remediation hints.\r\n\r\n### Skill Executor\r\n- `executeSkill(skillId, inputs, context)` -> Runs skill with constraint validation and audit log.\r\n- `dryRunSkill(skillId, inputs, context)` -> Validates constraints and expected outputs only.\r\n\r\n### Skill Suggestor\r\n- `suggestSkills(persona, requestContext, projectProfile)` -> Ranked suggestions + rationale.\r\n- `dismissSuggestion(skillId, scope)` -> Dismiss for session, project, or global scope.\r\n\r\n### Marketplace Adapter\r\n- `searchMarketplace(query, filters)` -> Search skill packages across trusted sources.\r\n- `installSkill(packageRef, version)` -> Downloads, verifies, registers skill.\r\n- `verifySignature(packageRef)` -> Checks trust chain for external skills.\r\n\r\n### Audit Log\r\n- `logEvent(eventType, payload)` -> Appends to immutable log.\r\n- `queryEvents(filters)` -> Returns filtered audit events for compliance review.\r\n\r\n## Module UI States and Flows\r\n### Alden\r\n- **Skill panel:** Enable/disable defaults; show suggestions with rationale.\r\n- **Request flow:** User request -> suggestor ranks skills -> user approves -> resolver applies.\r\n- **Override flow:** User adds/removes skills per agent -> audit log entry -> resolver updates.\r\n\r\n### Alice\r\n- **Behavioral guardrails:** Non-behavioral skills hidden unless user toggles override.\r\n- **Suggestion flow:** Conversation cues -> behavioral suggestions -> user confirm -> apply.\r\n- **Tone tools:** Skills can expose tone sliders or templates inside the chat UI.\r\n\r\n### Mimic\r\n- **Marketplace flow:** Search -> filter by persona/trust -> install -> assign to agent.\r\n- **Agent builder:** Choose persona template -> apply skill bundle -> validate with resolver.\r\n- **Bundle export:** Save skill bundle as reusable template; includes version pins.\r\n\r\n### Sentry\r\n- **Security-only view:** Only security domain skills visible by default.\r\n- **Override flow:** Non-security skill -> warning modal -> require explicit approval.\r\n- **Compliance view:** Audit log and project profile visibility for security review.\r\n\r\n### Core\r\n- **Project profile editor:** Define mandatory/optional skills, trust levels, version pins.\r\n- **Entry check:** On project start -> validate agent skill set -> align or block.\r\n- **Drift remediation:** Version mismatch -> prompt update/disable -> log decision.\r\n\r\n##

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
