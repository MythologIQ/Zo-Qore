Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It focuses on architecture and integration points, not product requirements.\r\n\r\n## Architecture Goals\r\n- Unified skill model that works across all persona modules.\r\n- Persona-scoped defaults and restrictions, with user overrides.\r\n- Skill discovery, installation, and assignment flows through Mimic.\r\n- Core project process profile enforces alignment to prevent drift.\r\n- Auditable skill lifecycle and version pinning.\r\n\r\n## Shared Skill Platform (All Modules)\r\n### Components\r\n- Skill Registry: Local index of installed skills (native + external).\r\n- Skill Resolver: Matches skills to persona, agent, and project constraints.\r\n- Skill Executor: Runs skill instructions using allowed tools and constraints.\r\n- Skill Audit Log: Tracks installs, overrides, versions, and enforcement.\r\n\r\n### Data Model\r\n- Skill Manifest: id, name, version, description, persona_scope, domain_tags, trust_level, source, triggers, constraints, inputs, outputs.\r\n- Agent Skill Profile: persona defaults + agent overrides + project alignment.\r\n- Project Process Profile (Core): mandatory skills, optional skills, pinned versions, allowed trust levels.\r\n\r\n### Core Flows\r\n- Install/Update: Resolve skill package, verify trust, store manifest, index in registry.\r\n- Assign: Apply persona defaults, agent overrides, and project constraints.\r\n- Execute: Validate constraints, run skill through executor, log usage.\r\n- Audit: Persist all changes and relevant events to audit log.\r\n\r\n## Persona Modules\r\n\r\n### Alden\r\n- Integration: Uses shared registry and resolver for general-purpose skills.\r\n- Defaults: Operations, planning, documentation, release, incident workflows.\r\n- Overrides: User can attach specialist skills for the session or agent.\r\n- UI: Skill panel for enabling/disabling, with suggestions based on request.\r\n\r\n### Alice\r\n- Integration: Uses shared registry and resolver with behavioral domain filters.\r\n- Defaults: Facilitation, behavioral analysis, communication synthesis.\r\n- Constraints: Guardrails on non-behavioral domains unless user overrides.\r\n- UI: Suggested skills derived from conversational cues and goals.\r\n\r\n### Mimic\r\n- Integration: Full access to registry, installer, and marketplace adapters.\r\n- Primary role: Skill discovery, curation, and custom agent construction.\r\n- Features: Persona templates, skill bundles, install/enable flows.\r\n- UI: Marketplace search, trust filters, install/assign wizard.\r\n\r\n### Sentry\r\n- Integration: Resolver enforces security-only domain by default.\r\n- Defaults: Threat modeling, compliance checks, security review.\r\n- Constraints: Non-security skills blocked unless explicit override.\r\n- UI: Security badge and policy messaging for overrides.\r\n\r\n## Core Module (Process Standardization)\r\n### Project Process Profile\r\n- Defines mandatory skills across all agents on a project.\r\n- Sets allowed skill versions and trust levels to avoid drift.\r\n- Applies to all personas participating in the project.\r\n\r\n### Enforcement Pipeline\r\n- On project entry: Validate agent skill profile vs project profile.\r\n- On mismatch: Warn, disable noncompliant skills, or prompt for alignment.\r\n- On override: Require explicit approval and log in audit trail.\r\n\r\n### Drift Prevention\r\n- Version pinning required for project-mandated skills.\r\n- Resolver rejects skills outside pinned version or trust levels.\r\n- Agents switching personas in-project must remain aligned.\r\n\r\n## Skill Suggestions\r\n- Suggestor service uses persona scope, user request, and project context.\r\n- Suggestions are ranked and include rationale.\r\n- Users can accept, ignore, or permanently dismiss.\r\n\r\n## Marketplace and Repositories\r\n- Mimic uses Marketplace Adapter to fetch, verify, and install skills.\r\n- Signature verification required for external skills.\r\n- Trust tiers: native, verified, community, with configurable allowlist.\r\n\r\n## Integration Points\r\n- UI modules call into shared Skill Registry and Resolver.\r\n- Executor exposes a consistent API for running skills.\r\n- Audit log accessible to Core and Sentry for compliance review.\r\n\r\n## Component APIs and Interfaces\r\n### Skill Registry\r\n- `registerSkill(manifest)` -> Stores or updates skill metadata and indexes it by id/version.\r\n- `listSkills(filters)` -> Returns skills by persona_scope, domain_tags, trust_level, version.\r\n- `getSkill(id, version)` -> Returns a specific manifest or latest allowed version.\r\n\r\n### Skill Resolver\r\n- `resolvePersonaSkills(persona, context)` -> Persona defaults + overrides + project constraints.\r\n- `resolveAgentSkills(agentId, context)` -> Agent profile derived from persona + agent overrides.\r\n- `validateSkillSet(skillSet, projectProfile)` -> Returns compliance status + remediation hints.\r\n\r\n### Skill Executor\r\n- `executeSkill(skillId, inputs, context)` -> Runs skill with constraint validation and audit log.\r\n- `dryRunSkill(skillId, inputs, context)` -> Validates constraints and expected outputs only.\r\n\r\n### Skill Suggestor\r\n- `suggestSkills(persona, requestContext, projectProfile)` -> Ranked suggestions + rationale.\r\n- `dismissSuggestion(skillId, scope)` -> Dismiss for session, project, or global scope.\r\n\r\n### Marketplace Adapter\r\n- `searchMarketplace(query, filters)` -> Search skill packages across trusted sources.\r\n- `installSkill(packageRef, version)` -> Downloads, verifies, registers skill.\r\n- `verifySignature(packageRef)` -> Checks trust chain for external skills.\r\n\r\n### Audit Log\r\n- `logEvent(eventType, payload)` -> Appends to immutable log.\r\n- `queryEvents(filters)` -> Returns filtered audit events for compliance review.\r\n\r\n## Module UI States and Flows\r\n### Alden\r\n- **Skill panel:** Enable/disable defaults; show suggestions with rationale.\r\n- **Request flow:** User request -> suggestor ranks skills -> user approves -> resolver applies.\r\n- **Override flow:** User adds/removes skills per agent -> audit log entry -> resolver updates.\r\n\r\n### Alice\r\n- **Behavioral guardrails:** Non-behavioral skills hidden unless user toggles override.\r\n- **Suggestion flow:** Conversation cues -> behavioral suggestions -> user confirm -> apply.\r\n- **Tone tools:** Skills can expose tone sliders or templates inside the chat UI.\r\n\r\n### Mimic\r\n- **Marketplace flow:** Search -> filter by persona/trust -> install -> assign to agent.\r\n- **Agent builder:** Choose persona template -> apply skill bundle -> validate with resolver.\r\n- **Bundle export:** Save skill bundle as reusable template; includes version pins.\r\n\r\n### Sentry\r\n- **Security-only view:** Only security domain skills visible by default.\r\n- **Override flow:** Non-security skill -> warning modal -> require explicit approval.\r\n- **Compliance view:** Audit log and project profile visibility for security review.\r\n\r\n### Core\r\n- **Project profile editor:** Define mandatory/optional skills, trust levels, version pins.\r\n- **Entry check:** On project start -> validate agent skill set -> align or block.\r\n- **Drift remediation:** Version mismatch -> prompt update/disable -> log decision.\r\n\r\n##

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
