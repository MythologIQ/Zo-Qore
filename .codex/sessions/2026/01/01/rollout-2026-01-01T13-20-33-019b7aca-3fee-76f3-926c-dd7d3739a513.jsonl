Each agent has a distinct role and is configured with a specific skill prompt from the `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n## Core Development Team\n\n### 1. Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

This can cause unnecessary re-renders and layout work.\\n- `EmailInbox` rebuilds keyboard handlers and list callbacks frequently; a stable event handler + memoized row components would reduce churn.\\n- Task and email lists are fully re-fetched after each mutation; optimistic updates would avoid extra network/IPC and reduce UI flicker.\\n- Calendar view recomputes arrays in render; memoizing month/week grids would help on slower devices.\\n\\n### Accessibility\\n- Modal accessibility is inconsistent. `src/components/shared/premium/PremiumModal.tsx` lacks `role=\\\"dialog\\\"`, `aria-modal`, focus trap, and Escape handling.\\n- Interactive divs without keyboard affordances exist (example: month cells in `src/components/alden/CalendarView.tsx` are clickable but not focusable).\\n- ARIA usage is uneven; some buttons rely on icons only without labels (example: recurring icon button in `src/components/alden/TaskManager.tsx`).\\n- `role=\\\"application\\\"` in `src/components/alden/EmailInbox.tsx` may reduce screen reader navigation support unless justified.\\n\\n## Answers to Specific Questions\\n- Can TaskManager, EmailInbox, CalendarView share a common data table component?\\n  - TaskManager and EmailInbox can share a DataList/DataTable with row actions, selection, and empty/error states. CalendarView is a schedule grid and should not be forced into the same table, but its day/week list mode could reuse a shared list row and empty state.\\n- Are we using too many different modal/dialog patterns?\\n  - Yes. PremiumModal, HearthlinkModal, and custom overlays are all in use, with differing behavior and accessibility.\\n- Is the sidebar navigation consistent across personas?\\n  - No. There are multiple sidebars (chat, navigation, persona-specific panels) with different layouts, spacing, and collapse behaviors.\\n- Are accessibility patterns applied uniformly?\\n  - No. ARIA labeling, keyboard navigation, and focus management are inconsistent across screens and modals.\\n\\n## Consolidation Plan\\n\\n### Shared Component Library (Extract/Standardize)\\n1. UnifiedAppShell\\n   - Base command center layout with header, tabs, sidebar, and content slots.\\n   - Consolidate `UnifiedCommandCenter` variants and shared sidebar patterns.\\n2. DataList / DataTable\\n   - Reusable list/table component with selection, keyboard nav, row actions, and bulk actions.\\n   - Primary targets: `src/components/alden/TaskManager.tsx`, `src/components/alden/EmailInbox.tsx`, Vault lists.\\n3. Modal/Dialog System\\n   - Single modal primitive with focus trap, keyboard handling, and consistent sizing.\\n   - Replace PremiumModal and HearthlinkModal variants.\\n4. StatusSurface\\n   - Standardized Loading, Error, Empty, Success banners with consistent layout and ARIA live regions.\\n5. FormField\\n   - Shared label, help, error message, and input wrapper.\\n6. Navigation Components\\n   - One sidebar and one module navigator pattern used across personas.\\n7. CommandPalette Integration\\n   - Central provider and shortcut map; hook into persona routes and command centers.\\n\\n### CSS / Design System Standards\\n- Define a single token set in Tailwind config (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radii).\\n- Map persona themes to CSS variables rather than hard-coded hex values.\\n- Standardize typography: base font, heading scale, letter spacing rules, and font utility usage.\\n- Limit custom inline styles to exceptional cases; prefer Tailwind tokens and component variants.\\n- Align icon usage and button variants to shared primitives (shadcn or Premium, not both).\\n\\n### Refactoring Priorities\\n1. P0: Modal consolidation with accessibility (fix `PremiumModal` role, focus trap, Escape, restore focus).\\n2. P0: Unified command center shell (replace duplicate variants across personas).\\n3. P1: DataList/DataTable for TaskManager and EmailInbox list view.\\n4. P1: Standardize loading/error/empty states across modules.\\n5. P2: Consolidate navigation (sidebar + module navigator).\\n6. P2: Deprecate unused shared components (CommandPalette until integrated, duplicate ModuleNavigator).\\n\\n### Performance Quick Wins\\n- Add virtualization to message/task lists (react-window or similar).\\n- Memoize row components and use stable callbacks (`React.memo`, `useCallback`) for list renderers.\\n- Use optimistic updates for task/email mutations to avoid re-fetch and reduce churn.\\n- Precompute and memoize calendar grids by view mode.\\n- Split heavy persona dashboards into lazy-loaded routes to reduce initial render cost.\\n\\n## Notes\\n- `src/components/alden/CalendarView.tsx` and `src/components/vault/VaultDashboard.tsx` include non-ASCII artifacts in strings (likely encoding noise). This should be cleaned for UI polish and accessibility.\\n\\n## Proposed Next Steps\\n1. Decide on the primary UI component system (shadcn vs Premium) and align variants.\\n2. Implement modal foundation + accessibility fixes, then migrate 2-3 high-traffic modals.\\n3. Build DataList and migrate TaskManager + EmailInbox list views.\\n4. Integrate CommandPalette with persona routing and command centers.\\n'@ | Set-Content .agent/staging/FRONTEND_ENGINEER_REVIEW.md\",\"workdir\":\"g:\\\\MythologIQ\\\\Hearthlink\"}","call_id":"call_pNcHM1l1IzLRdMKZrTI3LaMP"}}
