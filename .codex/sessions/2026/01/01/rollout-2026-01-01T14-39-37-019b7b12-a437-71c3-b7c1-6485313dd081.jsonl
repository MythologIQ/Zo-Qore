Each agent has a distinct role and is configured with a specific skill prompt from the `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n## Core Development Team\n\n### 1. Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

This layer is the \"brain\" of Hearthlink, enabling it to learn and adapt over time.\r\n*   **Logical Design**:\r\n    *   **Pattern Recognition**: A real-time monitoring system (`ADHDPatternRecognition`) analyzes user activity streams to identify ADHD-specific behaviors like hyperfocus, attention decline, and distraction patterns. It is designed to use default values as a starting point before being fed real-time data.\r\n    *   **Intervention Engine**: A closed-loop system (`InterventionStrategyEngine`) that selects, delivers, and measures the effectiveness of personalized support strategies. It learns which interventions work best for the user in specific contexts and adapts its approach accordingly.\r\n    *   **Temporal Optimization**: This engine analyzes the user's energy and attention cycles throughout the day and week to recommend the optimal times for different types of tasks (e.g., scheduling high-focus work during peak energy hours).\r\n    *   **Cross-Session Learning**: The `AdvancedLearningSystem` aggregates the outcomes of interventions and schedule adherence to continuously refine its understanding of the user, ensuring the entire ecosystem becomes more effective with every interaction.\r\n\r\n#### dY\"< Proprietary Management Systems\r\n*   **Intention**: To provide deeply integrated, ADHD-optimized productivity tools that are more effective than generic, off-the-shelf solutions.\r\n*   **Logical Design**:\r\n    *   **Task Management**: A system (`ProprietaryTaskSystem`) that goes beyond simple to-do lists. It provides concrete executive function support (e.g., for task initiation), automatically breaks large tasks into manageable micro-steps, and integrates \"motivation hooks\" to aid with common ADHD challenges.\r\n    *   **Calendar System**: A custom-built calendar (`ProprietaryCalendarSystem`) that implements \"protective scheduling.\" It automatically adds buffer zones between events, blocks off time for deep work, and can intelligently reschedule based on the user's current energy and attention state to prevent overload.\r\n\r\n#### dY\"- External Integrations\r\n*   **Intention**: To connect Hearthlink to the user's existing digital life in a powerful and privacy-centric way.\r\n*   **Logical Design**:\r\n    *   **Discord Web Access**: A unique integration (`DiscordWebIntegration`) that uses browser automation (`Selenium`) to log into the Discord web client with the user's own credentials. This allows Hearthlink to read messages and send replies on any server the user has access to, without requiring a traditional Discord bot or special server permissions.\r\n    *   **Conversational Voice**: A complete voice interface (`ConversationalVoiceSystem`) that uses speech-to-text and text-to-speech engines (`speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`) to enable natural, hands-free interaction. The system manages a conversational state and employs ADHD-aware speech patterns (e.g., speaking slower and more calmly during periods of user stress).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## dY\"' Local-First Architecture\r\n\r\nHearthlink is built on a **local-first** philosophy. This means your data stays on your device, and the core AI functionalities work without needing to send sensitive information to the cloud.\r\n\r\n- **Local AI Processing**: All AI processing is handled locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), allowing you to run powerful language models directly on your machine.\r\n- **Privacy by Design**: No data is sent to external servers without your explicit consent. Telemetry and crash reporting are disabled by default.\r\n- **User Control**: You have complete control over your data, including the ability to manage, export, and delete it at any time.\r\n- **Offline Functionality**: Core features are designed to work offline, ensuring that you can always rely on Hearthlink, regardless of your internet connection.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## dYs? Quick Start\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n- Python 3.8 or higher\r\n- Windows 10+ (primary target), macOS, or Linux\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/WulfForge/Hearthlink.git\r\ncd Hearthlink\r\n# Install dependencies\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n# Run the main application\r\npython src/main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Logs:**\r\n- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Hearthlink\\logs\\hearthlink.log`\r\n- **Unix-like**: `~/.hearthlink/logs/hearthlink.log`\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nTo run the comprehensive test suite for all features, including the ADHD-specific integrations:\r\n```bash\r\npython test_adhd_integration_complete.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlden: Evolutionary feedback, context-tracking, LLM integration\r\nMimic: Extensible persona, plugin system, audit sandbox\r\nVault: Secure, encrypted, persona & communal memory\r\nCore: Multi-agent orchestration, roundtable, session management\r\nSentry: Local-only security, audit, anomaly detection\r\nSynapse: Plugin manifest system, sandboxed external API\r\n\r\n## dY>нЛ,? Compliance & Safety\r\n- **PLATINUM_BLOCKERS.md**: See [/docs/PLATINUM_BLOCKERS.md](/docs/PLATINUM_BLOCKERS.md) for all compliance, ethics, and neurodivergent support standards\r\n- **User Sovereignty**: User is always in control\r\n- **MIT License**: Permissive, but users are reminded of ethical guardrails\r\n\r\n## dY\"s Module & Testing Index\r\nMajor Modules (Details in /docs/ or /src/<module>/README.md)\r\n\r\nAlden: /src/personas/alden.py\r\n\r\nPersona Registry: /src/personas/registry.py\r\n\r\nPersona Lifecycle Manager: /src/personas/lifecycle.py\r\n\r\nAlice: /src/personas/alice.py\r\n\r\nMimic: /src/personas/mimic.py\r\n\r\nVault: /src/vault/vault.py\r\n\r\nCore: /src/core/core.py\r\n\r\nSynapse: /src/synapse/synapse.py\r\n\r\nSentry: /src/sentry/sentry.py\r\n\r\nConfiguration: /src/configuration/feature_flags.py\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\nCore tests: /tests/test_core_multi_agent.py, /tests/test_core_memory_management.py, /tests/run_core_tests.py\r\n\r\nPersona lifecycle tests: /tests/test_persona_lifecycle.py\r\n\r\nQA Checklist: /docs/appendix_h_developer_qa_platinum_checklists.md\r\n\r\nSee /docs/ for all implementation, integration, and testing details.\r\n\r\n### Configuration & Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- Runtime feature toggles are persisted to `config/feature_flags.json` using the tamper-evident\r\n  `FeatureFlagManager`.  Unit tests in `tests/test_feature_flags.py` cover persistence, signature\r\n  validation, and snapshot generation so QAOR can audit change control.\r\n- Persona-aligned preferences, notification controls, and retention policies are surfaced through\r\n  the Vault-backed `PreferencesManager` (`src/configuration/preferences.py`).  It enforces ownership\r\n  and delegate access, records change history, and exposes reset/export helpers.  Coverage lives in\r\n  `tests/test_preferences.py` so QAOR can track privacy guardrails.\r\n- Create or update flags from code by instantiating `FeatureFlagManager` with the desired storage,\r\n  audit, and snapshot locations.  Snapshots are written to `config/snapshots/` by default to support\r\n  rollback and support investigations.  Default rollout records live in `config/feature_flags.json`\r\n  so the workspace can ship with a safe baseline.\r\n- Nova and Cipher expose the workspace configuration experience through\r\n  `SettingsPanelService` (`src/configuration/settings_panel.py`).  It composes persona preferences and\r\n  feature flags into UI-ready sections, supports backup/reset flows, and powers the new\r\n  regression tests in `tests/test_settings_panel.py`.\r\n- When flipping a flag or updating preferences, always supply the acting agent (e.g., Cipher) and\r\n  reason so the audit chain remains complete; QAOR will verify signatures via\r\n  `verify_audit_chain()` during release reviews and review preference audit trails before rollout.\r\n- The operational runbook for exporting, restoring, and resetting configuration lives in\r\n  [`docs/configuration/operations.md`](docs/configuration/operations.md); support engineers must follow it\r\n  before touching production systems.\r\n\r\n### Memory System\r\n\r\n- Muse delivered the foundational memory repository in `src/core/memory/`, providing Vault-backed and\r\n  in-memory backends plus ranking heuristics for episodic, semantic, procedural, and working memories.\r\n- `MemoryRepository.build_context_window` now assembles budget-aware context payloads with trace metadata\r\n  so QAOR can audit which memories fed a prompt; see `tests/test_memory_repository.py` for regression\r\n  coverage across persona and communal scopes.\r\n- `PersonaMemoryBridge` (`src/personas/memory_bridge.py`) now links lifecycle telemetry and persona artefacts\r\n  directly into the repository with coverage in `tests/test_persona_memory_bridge.py` so QAOR can trace\r\n  provenance end-to-end.\r\n- `MemoryDashboardService` (`src/core/memory/dashboard.py`) now produces deterministic analytics snapshots\r\n  (type breakdowns, top tags, recent activity) for the forthcoming Memory Dashboard UX. Regression coverage\r\n  in `tests/test_memory_dashboard.py` keeps QAOR's telemetry evidence actionable for Issue #05.\r\n- Remaining Issue #26 work (Memory Dashboard UX + reconciliation automation) is tracked in the Codex sprint\r\n  orchestration docs while Nova and Muse collaborate on the workspace integration plan.\r\n\r\nГsTЛ,? Development Workflow\r\nModular, Branch-Per-Feature:\r\nSee Process Refinement\r\n\r\nRegular pushes to GitHub required for every milestone\r\n\r\nSingle README in root is authoritative (all others are legacy and will be removed)\r\n\r\ndY-,Л,? Planning Artefacts\r\n- The eighteen architecture-driven issues (alpha launch plus follow-on work) are stored under\r\n  [`docs/planning/issues/`](docs/planning/issues/). Each Markdown file maps directly to a GitHub issue with summary,\r\n  tasks, acceptance criteria, and code/documentation references. The live GitHub tracker now holds these as\r\n  issues `#22`Г?\"`#39`, continuing from earlier repository history; future imports should continue from the\r\n  latest number rather than attempting to renumber them `#1`Г?\"`#18`.\r\n- Use [`scripts/import_issues.py`](scripts/import_issues.py) with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to create the live issues. Run with\r\n  `--dry-run` first to review the payloads.\r\n- The Codex sprint working plan lives under [`docs/planning/codex-sprint/`](docs/planning/codex-sprint/):\r\n  `agents.md` defines the specialised execution team (now including Scribe, the technical writer),\r\n  `execution-roadmap.md` sequences all eighteen issues, and `system-evaluation.md` records QAOR's\r\n  end-to-end testing status and quality gates.\r\n- External collaborators should pick up briefs from\r\n  [`codex-sprint/external-contributions.md`](docs/planning/codex-sprint/external-contributions.md), which outlines\r\n  well-scoped tasks (branch strategy, Definition of Done, QA checkpoints) for third-party agents to\r\n  deliver via reviewable feature branches.\r\n- Active external pull requests (#20 and #21) must rebase onto `work` to adopt the new compatibility\r\n  shims (`initialize_persona_registry`, `core/vault_state_manager.py`, and `src/personas/alden_enhanced.py`).\r\n  Progress and remediation guidance is tracked in\r\n  [`docs/planning/pr-test-review-2025-02-14.md`](docs/planning/pr-test-review-2025-02-14.md).\r\n- Scribe's module library begins under [`docs/modules/`](docs/modules/) with a detailed memory-system\r\n  guide; expand it as additional features ship so onboarding and troubleshooting stay current.\r\n- The living risk register resides in [`docs/planning/risk-register.md`](docs/planning/risk-register.md); update it in PRs\r\n  whenever mitigations or severities change.\r\n\r\ndY\u000f?

Using `createPortal(jsx, document.body)` renders it at the root level.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Module Resident AI Mapping\r\n\r\n| Module          | Resident AI | Color Theme      |\r\n| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |\r\n| Alden (default) | Alden       | Gold (#d6b369)   |\r\n| Core            | Alden       | Gold             |\r\n| Vault           | Sentry      | Red (#ef4444)    |\r\n| Alice           | Alice       | Blue (#3b82f6)   |\r\n| Mimic           | Mimic       | Purple (#a855f7) |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n1. **SidebarChat expand/collapse** - Buttons not fully wired; need visual verification\r\n2. **Ghost chat window** - May appear if UnifiedCommandCenter's default GlobalCommsStream shows behind custom sidebar\r\n3. **ACTUAL_STATUS.md** - Outdated (Oct 2025), needs update after current fixes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps (Priority Order)\r\n\r\n1. [ ] Verify SidebarChat 3-state functionality in browser\r\n2. [ ] Update ACTUAL_STATUS.md with current state\r\n3. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to VaultDashboard\r\n4. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to other module dashboards\r\n5. [ ] Address 8 accessibility E2E failures\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Alignment Checklist\r\n\r\n### Master Documentation Alignment\r\n\r\n- [x] Core Session architecture (Section 5) - Room/session management defined\r\n- [x] Persona memory isolation (Vault Section 4) - No cross-persona leakage\r\n- [x] UI Component standards (Appendix P) - React components with TypeScript\r\n- [x] Accessibility (Appendix U) - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support\r\n- [x] Expanded Chat spec (Appendix EE) - 4-column layout implemented\r\n\r\n### KISS Compliance\r\n\r\n- [x] Components have single responsibility\r\n- [x] State is lifted to appropriate level (dashboard manages sidebar state)\r\n- [x] Portal used for overlay instead of complex z-index management\r\n- [ ] Visual verification of all states pending\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_This document is the source of truth for current system state. Update after each significant change._\r\n"}}

Fix Compilation Errors (30 minutes)\r\n\r\n#### Step 1A: Remove Dead Tutorial Imports\r\n**File:** `src/App.tsx`\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- import { useFirstSevenDaysTour } from './hooks/useFirstSevenDaysTour';\r\n- import { FirstSevenDaysOverlay } from './components/tutorial/FirstSevenDaysOverlay';\r\n\r\n  // Remove any usage in JSX:\r\n- <FirstSevenDaysOverlay ... />\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Verify:**\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run compile:ts\r\n# Should show 0 warnings about missing module\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 1B: Fix TypeScript Type Errors\r\n**File:** `src/hooks/useSession.ts` (lines 86-92)\r\n\r\n**Current (broken):**\r\n```typescript\r\nbridgeRef.current.subscribe((event) => {  // event is 'unknown'\r\n  if (event.type === 'message_sent') {    // TS ERROR\r\n    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, event.data as CoreMessage]);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n```typescript\r\n// Add type definition at top of file\r\ninterface BridgeEvent {\r\n  type: 'message_sent' | 'session_updated';\r\n  data: CoreMessage | CoreSession;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Update subscription\r\nbridgeRef.current.subscribe((event: BridgeEvent) => {\r\n  if (event.type === 'message_sent') {\r\n    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, event.data as CoreMessage]);\r\n  } else if (event.type === 'session_updated') {\r\n    setSession(event.data as CoreSession);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Verify:**\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run compile:ts\r\n# Should show 0 TypeScript errors\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Success Criteria:**\r\n- [ ] `npm run compile:ts` passes with zero errors\r\n- [ ] Git status clean (no broken imports)\r\n- [ ] Commit with message: `fix: resolve compilation errors (dead imports + type safety)`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Create Shared Hook Library (90 minutes)\r\n\r\n#### Step 2A: Create useBridgeQuery Hook\r\n\r\n**Create file:** `src/hooks/useBridgeQuery.ts`\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';\r\nimport type { BridgeResponse } from '../types/agents';\r\n\r\nexport interface UseBridgeQueryOptions<TData> {\r\n  queryFn: () => Promise<BridgeResponse<TData>>;\r\n  onSuccess?: (data: TData) => void;\r\n  onError?: (error: string) => void;\r\n  enabled?: boolean;\r\n  refetchInterval?: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface UseBridgeQueryResult<TData> {\r\n  data: TData | null;\r\n  loading: boolean;\r\n  error: string | null;\r\n  refetch: () => Promise<void>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function useBridgeQuery<TData>(\r\n  options: UseBridgeQueryOptions<TData>\r\n): UseBridgeQueryResult<TData> {\r\n  const [data, setData] = useState<TData | null>(null);\r\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\r\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\r\n\r\n  const refetch = useCallback(async () => {\r\n    setLoading(true);\r\n    setError(null);\r\n    try {\r\n      const response = await options.queryFn();\r\n      if (response.success && response.data) {\r\n        setData(response.data);\r\n        options.onSuccess?.(response.data);\r\n      } else {\r\n        const errorMsg = response.error || 'Query failed';\r\n        setError(errorMsg);\r\n        options.onError?.(errorMsg);\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n      const errorMsg = err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Query failed';\r\n      setError(errorMsg);\r\n      options.onError?.(errorMsg);\r\n    } finally {\r\n      setLoading(false);\r\n    }\r\n  }, [options]);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (options.enabled !== false) {\r\n      refetch();\r\n    }\r\n  }, [refetch, options.enabled]);\r\n\r\n  // Auto-refetch interval\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (options.refetchInterval && options.enabled !== false) {\r\n      const interval = setInterval(refetch, options.refetchInterval);\r\n      return () => clearInterval(interval);\r\n    }\r\n  }, [refetch, options.refetchInterval, options.enabled]);\r\n\r\n  return { data, loading, error, refetch };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 2B: Create useModal Hook\r\n\r\n**Create file:** `src/hooks/useModal.ts`\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport interface UseModalResult {\r\n  isOpen: boolean;\r\n  open: () => void;\r\n  close: () => void;\r\n  toggle: () => void;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function useModal(initialOpen = false): UseModalResult {\r\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(initialOpen);\r\n\r\n  const open = useCallback(() => setIsOpen(true), []);\r\n  const close = useCallback(() => setIsOpen(false), []);\r\n  const toggle = useCallback(() => setIsOpen(prev => !prev), []);\r\n\r\n  return { isOpen, open, close, toggle };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 2C: Test in One CommandCenter\r\n\r\n**Example: Refactor VaultCommandCenter.tsx to use useBridgeQuery**\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n```typescript\r\nconst [memories, setMemories] = useState<MemorySlice[]>([]);\r\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\r\nconst [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  const loadMemories = async () => {\r\n    setLoading(true);\r\n    try {\r\n      const response = await VaultBridge.getMemories(userId);\r\n      if (response.success) {\r\n        setMemories(response.data);\r\n      } else {\r\n        setError(response.error || 'Failed');\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n      setError(err.message);\r\n    } finally {\r\n      setLoading(false);\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  loadMemories();\r\n}, [userId]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { useBridgeQuery } from '../../hooks/useBridgeQuery';\r\n\r\nconst { data: memories, loading, error, refetch } = useBridgeQuery({\r\n  queryFn: () => VaultBridge.getMemories(userId),\r\n  onError: (err) => console.error('[Vault] Failed to load memories:', err)\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Success Criteria:**\r\n- [ ] `useBridgeQuery` hook created\r\n- [ ] `useModal` hook created\r\n- [ ] At least one CommandCenter successfully refactored\r\n- [ ] No regressions in functionality\r\n- [ ] Commit: `feat: add shared hook library (useBridgeQuery, useModal)`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps (This Week)\r\n\r\n### Day 2-3: Extract Shared Components\r\n\r\n**Priority: MetricCard**\r\n\r\n**Why:** Used in 6+ CommandCenters, 400+ lines of duplication\r\n\r\n**Action:**\r\n1. Create `src/components/shared/MetricCard.tsx`\r\n2. Extract common styling/logic from AldenCommandCenter\r\n3. Migrate all CommandCenters to use it\r\n4. Create Storybook story\r\n\r\n**Files to update:**\r\n- `src/components/alden/AldenCommandCenter.tsx`\r\n- `src/components/vault/VaultCommandCenter.tsx`\r\n- `src/components/sentry/SentryCommandCenter.tsx`\r\n- `src/components/mimic/MimicCommandCenter.tsx`\r\n- `src/components/alice/AliceCommandCenter.tsx`\r\n- `src/components/synapse/SynapseCommandCenter.tsx`\r\n\r\n### Day 4-5: Unify Chat Hooks\r\n\r\n**Priority: Eliminate useChatState duplication**\r\n\r\n**Action:**\r\n1. Create `src/components/shared/chat/useUnifiedChatState.ts`\r\n2. Implement strategy pattern (orchestration vs direct)\r\n3. Migrate all CommandCenters\r\n4. Delete old hooks\r\n\r\n**Files to delete:**\r\n- `src/components/shared/chat/useChatState.ts`\r\n- `src/components/shared/chat/useChatStateWithOrchestration.ts`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick Reference: Common Refactoring Patterns\r\n\r\n### Pattern 1: Replace Loading State Boilerplate\r\n\r\n**Before (30 lines):**\r\n```typescript\r\nconst [data, setData] = useState(null);\r\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\r\nconst [error, setError] = useState(null);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  const load = async () => {\r\n    setLoading(true);\r\n    try {\r\n      const res = await Bridge.getData();\r\n      if (res.success) setData(res.data);\r\n      else setError(res.error);\r\n    } catch (e) {\r\n      setError(e.message);\r\n    } finally {\r\n      setLoading(false);\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  load();\r\n}, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After (3 lines):**\r\n```typescript\r\nconst { data, loading, error } = useBridgeQuery({\r\n  queryFn: () => Bridge.getData()\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pattern 2: Replace Modal State\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n```typescript\r\nconst [isCreateModalOpen, setIsCreateModalOpen] = useState(false);\r\n\r\nconst openCreateModal = () => setIsCreateModalOpen(true);\r\nconst closeCreateModal = () => setIsCreateModalOpen(false);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n```typescript\r\nconst createModal = useModal();\r\n// Usage: createModal.open(), createModal.close(), createModal.isOpen\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pattern 3: Extract Duplicated Components\r\n\r\n**Identify:**\r\n```bash\r\n# Find duplicate component logic\r\ngrep -r \"const MetricCard = \" src/components\r\n# If appears in 3+ files ƒ+' Extract to shared\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Extract:**\r\n1. Create `src/components/shared/ComponentName.tsx`\r\n2. Move common logic\r\n3. Add TypeScript types\r\n4. Update imports in all files\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Pre-Merge Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore merging any refactoring work:\r\n\r\n**Code Quality:**\r\n- [ ] `npm run compile:ts` passes (zero errors)\r\n- [ ] `npm run test` passes (all tests green)\r\n- [ ] No new ESLint warnings\r\n- [ ] No console.log/debugger statements\r\n\r\n**Functionality:**\r\n- [ ] Manual testing in all affected modules\r\n- [ ] Chat still works (both private + group)\r\n- [ ] Bridge calls still succeed\r\n- [ ] No visual regressions\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to new hooks/components\r\n- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if architecture changed\r\n- [ ] Add Storybook story for new shared components\r\n\r\n**Git:**\r\n- [ ] Meaningful commit messages (conventional commits)\r\n- [ ] Small, atomic commits (not giant refactors)\r\n- [ ] Branch name follows pattern: `refactor/{description}`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Help & Resources\r\n\r\n**Questions?**\r\n- Check `REFACTORING_STRATEGY.md` for detailed plan\r\n- Ask in #frontend-dev Slack channel\r\n- Tag @frontend-lead for architecture decisions\r\n\r\n**Common Issues:**\r\n\r\n**Issue:** TypeScript errors after refactoring\r\n**Fix:** Run `npm run compile:ts` frequently, fix as you go\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Tests failing after hook extraction\r\n**Fix:** Update test mocks to include new hooks\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Performance regression\r\n**Fix:** Use React DevTools Profiler, compare before/after\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Ready to start?** Begin with Step 1A (30 minutes to green build).\r\n"}}
