This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai","git":{}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Project Overview\r\n\r\nThe Nexus Command Console is a sophisticated observability and orchestration interface designed to manage a complex ecosystem of AI agents, Docker-based microservices, and RAG-enabled data infrastructure. Its primary purpose is to provide a centralized hub for developers to monitor, control, and interact with various interconnected components, including a localized AI agent (\"Alden\"), a specialized web crawling and RAG MCP server (\"Crawl4ai-rag\"), and a browser integration layer via a Chrome Extension (\"Nexus Lens\").\r\n\r\nThe ecosystem is geared towards enabling advanced AI-driven tasks, data acquisition, and context-aware assistance for AI agents and coding assistants. The Console itself serves as the primary user interface into this system.\r\n\r\n## 2. System Architecture & Components\r\n\r\nThe Nexus system is composed of several key, interconnected components:\r\n\r\n### 2.1. Nexus Command Console (Frontend)\r\n\r\n*   **Technology:** React (with Vite), TailwindCSS.\r\n*   **Purpose:** The main user interface for monitoring and controlling the entire Nexus ecosystem.\r\n*   **Functionalities:**\r\n    *   Displays operational status from Alden, Crawl4ai-rag, and Docker containers.\r\n    *   Provides interactive controls for these components.\r\n    *   Features a chat interface for communicating with Alden and potentially other system agents (via \"Nexus Core\" context).\r\n    *   Manages and displays memory inventory, logs, tasks, and system metrics.\r\n    *   Initiates file ingestion processes.\r\n*   **Communication:** Interacts with backend services (likely \"Gatekeeper\") via HTTP/WebSocket and MCP servers (like Crawl4ai-rag) via SSE or stdio.\r\n\r\n### 2.2. Alden (Local AI Agent)\r\n\r\n*   **Purpose:** A localized AI agent with capabilities for reflection, learning, and maintaining a personality. It operates with its own RAG database and a unique \"wake-up\" protocol.\r\n*   **Backend:**\r\n    *   Technology: Python, Flask.\r\n    *   API: Provides endpoints for submitting prompts (`/submit_prompt`), retrieving feedback queues (`/feedback_queue`), user-specific conversation threads (`/user_thread/:user_id`), and detailed memory slices (`/slice/:slice_id`).\r\n*   **Memory & Personality:**\r\n    *   Database: SQLite (`Alden/backend/memory/alden_memory.db`) stores procedural memory, RAG chunks, and metadata.\r\n    *   Personality Vector: `Alden/backend/memory/personality_vector.json` stores evolving personality traits and reflections.\r\n    *   Memory Slices: Individual JSON files (e.g., `Alden/backend/memory/slices/init_roan.json`) capture specific reflections or interactions.\r\n*   **Engine & Constructs:**\r\n    *   Mentor Manifests: Defines different AI mentors (e.g., Alice, Roan in `Alden/engine/`) that guide Alden's development.\r\n    *   Text Library: Utilizes a collection of texts (e.g., poetry, strategy books in `Alden/engine/library_manifest.json`) for learning and context.\r\n    *   Constructs: Thematic environments like \"Garden\" and \"Observatory\" (`Alden/constructs/construct_schema.json`) influence Alden's emotional state and mentor interactions.\r\n*   **Reflection Cycle:** Follows directives (`Alden/backend/runtime/directives.md`) for init, engage, reflect, archive, and respond phases.\r\n\r\n### 2.3. Crawl4ai-RAG (Web Crawling & RAG MCP Server)\r\n\r\n*   **Purpose:** An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server providing advanced web crawling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities.\r\n*   **Technology:** Python, using [Crawl4AI](https://crawl4ai.com) and an MCP server framework.\r\n*   **Tools (exposed via MCP):**\r\n    *   `crawl_single_page`: Crawls and indexes a single web page.\r\n    *   `smart_crawl_url`: Intelligently crawls based on URL type (sitemap, `llms-full.txt`, or recursive webpage crawl).\r\n    *   `get_available_sources`: Lists available data sources (domains) for RAG.\r\n    *   `perform_rag_query`: Performs semantic search over crawled content, with optional source filtering.\r\n*   **Database:** Supabase (Postgres with `pgvector` extension) for storing crawled pages and their embeddings (`Crawl4ai-rag/crawled_pages.sql`).\r\n*   **Embeddings:** Utilizes OpenAI API for generating embeddings.\r\n*   **Communication:** Supports SSE (Server-Sent Events) and stdio transports for MCP communication.\r\n*   **Configuration:** Managed via an `.env` file (OpenAI key, Supabase credentials, server host/port).\r\n\r\n### 2.4. Gatekeeper (System Backend & WebSocket Hub)\r\n\r\n*   **Location:** `backend/gatekeeper.js` (formerly `legacy code/bridgekeeper.js`)\r\n*   **Purpose:** Acts as a central communication hub and API gateway for the Nexus Command Console frontend. It manages WebSocket connections, sessions, and routes commands/data between the console, Alden, and the Chrome extension.\r\n*   **Technology:** Node.js, Express, WebSocket (`ws` module).\r\n*   **APIs (Served):**\r\n    *   Serves API endpoints for `/api/containers`, `/api/events`, `/api/system/status`, `/api/ingest`, `/api/gemini/generate`, etc.\r\n    *   `/api/status` (HTTP endpoint for basic health check).\r\n*   **WebSocket Server:** Runs on a configurable port (e.g., 8765 or same as HTTP), handling client sessions, message routing.\r\n*   **Authentication:** Uses a token (`GATEKEEPER_TOKEN`) for WebSocket connections.\r\n*   **Logging:** Produces structured logs to daily rotated files.\r\n\r\n### 2.5. Nexus Lens (Chrome Extension)\r\n\r\n*   **Location:** `Nexus-suite/Nexus/extension/` (formerly `legacy code/extension/`)\r\n*   **Purpose:** Provides browser integration, allowing interaction with web pages, identifying agents within tabs, and relaying information to/from the backend (Gatekeeper).\r\n*   **Components:**\r\n    *   `manifest.json`: Defines permissions and host permissions.\r\n    *   `background.js`: Service worker for managing WebSocket connection to Gatekeeper and message listening.\r\n    *   `content-minimal.js`: Injected into web pages to detect agents, log interactions, and communicate with `background.js`.\r\n    *   `popup.html/js/css`: UI for the extension, showing connection status and providing controls.\r\n    *   `modules/AgentMemory.js`: Module for managing agent-related memory.\r\n\r\n## 3. Technology Stack\r\n\r\n*   **Frontend (Nexus Command Console):** React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript (powered by Vite).\r\n*   **Backend (Gatekeeper - Console Backend):** Node.js, Express, WebSocket (`ws` module).\r\n*   **Backend (Alden - Local AI):** Python, Flask.\r\n*   **Backend (Crawl4ai-RAG - MCP Server):** Python, Crawl4AI, MCP framework.\r\n*   **Databases:**\r\n    *   **Alden Local RAG & Personality:** SQLite.\r\n    *   **Crawl4ai-RAG Content:** Supabase (Postgres with `pgvector`).\r\n    *   **Gatekeeper Events/Logs (Primary):** File-based (rotated text logs). (Supabase for Alden events if configured).\r\n*   **AI & Embeddings:** Gemini API (via Gatekeeper), OpenAI API (for Crawl4ai-RAG).\r\n*   **Containerization:** Docker.\r\n*   **Browser Extension:** Standard WebExtension technologies.\r\n\r\n## 4. Key Functionalities\r\n\r\n*   **Nexus Command Console:**\r\n    *   **Container Management:** Listing, starting, stopping, deleting Docker containers (interfacing with Gatekeeper).\r\n    *   **Task Logging & Tracking:** Displaying system events and commands from Gatekeeper.\r\n    *   **System Health & Metrics:** Visualizing system status from Gatekeeper.\r\n    *   **Chat Interface:** Centralized communication with Alden (proxied via Gatekeeper).\r\n    *   **File Ingestion:** UI to `POST /api/ingest` to Gatekeeper for RAG pipeline.\r\n    *   **Memory Inventory:** Displaying data from Alden and Crawl4ai-RAG (via Gatekeeper).\r\n    *   **Operations Hub:** Tabbed interface for Logs, Insights, Tasks, Crawl Sources.\r\n*   **Alden (Local AI):** (Functionality as described before, accessed via Gatekeeper if necessary)\r\n*   **Crawl4ai-RAG Server (MCP):** (Functionality as described before)\r\n*   **Gatekeeper (Backend):**\r\n    *   **WebSocket Communication:** Real-time bidirectional communication with Console frontend and Nexus Lens extension.\r\n    *   **Session Management:** Tracking connected WebSocket clients.\r\n    *   **Message Routing:** Directing messages between connected components.\r\n    *   **HTTP API Serving:** Exposing RESTful endpoints for console operations and proxying to other services.\r\n    *   **Logging:** Centralized logging to rotated files.\r\n*   **Nexus Lens (Chrome Extension):**\r\n    *   **Agent Detection & Communication:** Relaying messages to/from Gatekeeper.\r\n    *   **User Interface:** Popup for status and basic interactions.\r\n\r\n## 5.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

The current architecture distributes responsibilities across Sentry (security/compliance/diagnostics) and Vault (memory/RAG/context), with Core acting as an orchestrator shell. This shift gains depth in security and memory systems but loses a unified operations console (containers, system logs, backend status, agent core toggles). The missing pieces are best rehomed in either Sentry (diagnostics + risk) or a new System/Operations module rather than in Vault.\n+\n+## Component Mapping Matrix (Archived -> Current)\n+Legend: Coverage = Full / Partial / Missing\n+\n+| Archived Component | Purpose | Current Equivalent(s) | Coverage | Notes |\n+|---|---|---|---|---|\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/Header.tsx` | WS/Bridge/Console status indicators | `src/components/personas/SentryInterface.tsx` | Partial | Current diagnostics show system health but do not surface Bridge/Console verification states. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/DiagnosticsPanel.tsx` | Gatekeeper diagnostics overlay | `src/components/personas/SentryInterface.tsx` | Partial | Sentry shows health/alerts/context diagnostics; no direct Gatekeeper endpoint view. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/AgentPanel.tsx` | Agent list + Core On/Off toggle | No clear current match | Missing | No obvious module for agent core toggles. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/MemoryInventoryPanel.tsx` | Memory inventory + source filters | `src/components/vault/VaultCommandCenter.tsx` | Partial | Vault has richer memory views; the cross-source inventory summary is not exposed as a single quick panel. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/ContainersPanel.tsx` | Container controls (start/stop/delete) | No clear current match | Missing | Sentry/Vault/Core do not expose container ops UI. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/CombinedLogsPanel.tsx` | Activity + system logs | `src/components/sentry/SentryCommandCenter.tsx` (events), `src/components/personas/SentryInterface.tsx` (alerts) | Partial | Security events exist; operational/system logs do not. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/InsightsPanel.tsx` | System performance chart | Partial in Sentry diagnostics | Partial | Metrics exist in SentryInterface but not as time-series insights panel. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/RecentTasksPanel.tsx` | Recent tasks feed | No clear current match | Missing | Core has project/task systems, but not a consolidated recent-tasks feed. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/ChatConsolePanel.tsx` | Targeted multi-agent chat | `src/components/shared/chat/UnifiedChatContainer.tsx` | Partial | Orchestration exists but the explicit target dropdown UX is not present in Core/Sentry/Vault dashboards. |\n+| `archive/Core -Command-Console/components/Toolbar.tsx` | Quick actions (start services, upload, MCP, plugins) | No clear current match | Missing | These controls are absent or scattered. |\n+\n+## Gains vs Losses (Current Architecture)\n+### Gains\n+- Security/compliance depth: event/rule/report workflows in `src/components/sentry/SentryCommandCenter.tsx`.\n+- Memory/RAG depth: multi-view command center and knowledge graph in `src/components/vault/VaultCommandCenter.tsx`.\n+- Module separation aligns with `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`: clear personas and dashboards.\n+\n+### Losses\n+- Unified operations console (containers/logs/backend status) from archived Command Console is gone.\n+- Fast “system-at-a-glance” dashboard (Bridge/Console/WS) is not surfaced.\n+- Agent core toggles and utility actions (start services, ingest, MCP quick access) are not centralized.\n+\n+## Recommendations (Keep / Replace / Retire)\n+1. **Diagnostics + status indicators**\n+   - Recommendation: Replace old header/diagnostics with a Sentry “System Status” subpanel.\n+   - Owner: Sentry.\n+2. **Container management**\n+   - Recommendation: Reintroduce as a new System/Operations module or Sentry “Ops” tab.\n+   - Owner: New System module or Sentry.\n+3. **System logs**\n+   - Recommendation: Add to Sentry as “Operational Logs” (distinct from security events).\n+   - Owner: Sentry.\n+4. **Memory inventory quick panel**\n+   - Recommendation: Add Vault “Summary Inventory” widget (cross-source).\n+   - Owner: Vault.\n+5. **Recent tasks feed**\n+   - Recommendation: Add to Core as a lightweight activity feed tied to CoreBridge.\n+   - Owner: Core.\n+6. **Multi-target chat selector**\n+   - Recommendation: Enhance UnifiedChatContainer with explicit target routing UI.\n+   - Owner: Shared chat/Core.\n+7. **Utility toolbar**\n+   - Recommendation: Consolidate into new “System Tools” palette in Core or System module.\n+   - Owner: Core or System module.\n+\n+## Implementation Backlog (Stories + Acceptance Criteria)\n+### Story 1: Sentry System Status Panel\n+- **As** a user, **I want** a unified status view (Bridge/Console/WS + health metrics) **so that** I can confirm system health quickly.\n+- **Acceptance Criteria**\n+  - Displays WS/Bridge/Console status with clear labels.\n+  - Health metrics and alerts remain visible.\n+  - Refresh action updates status.\n+\n+### Story 2: Operational Logs in Sentry\n+- **As** a user, **I want** operational/system logs in Sentry **so that** I can diagnose non-security failures.\n+- **Acceptance Criteria**\n+  - Separate from security events.\n+  - Filterable by component and severity.\n+  - Timestamped entries.\n+\n+### Story 3: Container Management Module\n+- **As** a user, **I want** to start/stop/delete containers **so that** I can manage system services without leaving the UI.\n+- **Acceptance Criteria**\n+  - List containers with status and actions.\n+  - Actions report success/failure visibly.\n+  - Refresh updates list.\n+\n+### Story 4: Vault Inventory Summary Panel\n+- **As** a user, **I want** a quick inventory summary for memory sources **so that** I can see RAG vs local memory at a glance.\n+- **Acceptance Criteria**\n+  - Shows counts by source.\n+  - Links to deeper Vault views.\n+\n+### Story 5: Core Recent Activity Feed\n+- **As** a user, **I want** a recent tasks/events feed **so that** I can track system activity centrally.\n+- **Acceptance Criteria**\n+  - Shows recent task state changes.\n+  - Supports refresh.\n+\n+### Story 6: Targeted Chat Routing UI\n+- **As** a user, **I want** to route messages to specific agents **so that** I can direct interactions explicitly.\n+- **Acceptance Criteria**\n+  - Target selector in UnifiedChatContainer.\n+  - Messages are tagged by target.\n+\n+### Story 7: System Tools Palette\n+- **As** a user, **I want** quick access to common ops tools (ingest, MCP link, start services) **so that** I can manage workflows faster.\n+- **Acceptance Criteria**\n+  - Central palette with core actions.\n+  - Actions are discoverable and labeled.\n+\n+## Risks / Assumptions\n+- Tauri IPC availability for ops controls is assumed; may require backend endpoints.\n+- Some Gatekeeper-era endpoints may no longer exist; functionality may need new bridge methods.\n+\n+## Handoff Notes\n+This document is the completed review. If the planning agent needs additional verification or mockups, scope a follow-on task rather than extending this review.\n*** End Patch"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
