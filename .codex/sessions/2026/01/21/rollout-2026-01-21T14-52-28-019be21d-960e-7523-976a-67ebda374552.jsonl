This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Human by Design. Local by Default.\r\n1. Executive Summary\r\nHearthlink is a local-first AI assistant platform that solves the \"Faustian bargain\" of modern AI: the sacrifice of privacy for productivity. By moving the entire AI stackƒ?\"from the vector database to the LLMƒ?\"onto consumer hardware, Hearthlink eliminates cloud compute costs, mitigates $10M+ data breach risks, and provides a \"Balanced Team\" of AI personas designed for cognitive dignity and neurodivergent support.The Opportunity: Capitalizing on the $8.5B Agentic AI market and the 54% market penetration of AI PCs in 2026.2. Technical Architecture: The \"Sovereign Stack\"Model Strategy (Quantized On-Device LLMs)Hearthlink operates within a strictly local execution environment, typically constrained to ƒ%^8GB RAM. We utilize the Ollama engine to manage a rotation of high-capability, small-scale models:Primary Models: LLaMA 3.x (8B) and Mistral 7B, typically in 4-bit format (~3ƒ?\"5GB footprint).Performance: A 3B model yields 1ƒ?\"3 second response times on standard CPUs; 7ƒ?\"8B models are utilized for higher-accuracy reasoning tasks.Caching & Backend: The system maintains a default 4GB memory cache and can fall back to GPT4All or llama.cpp backends to ensure cross-hardware compatibility.Zero-Data Outbound: No inference data ever leaves the device, providing structural privacy and eliminating marginal compute costs.\"Vault\" RAG Architecture (Local Memory & Low-Latency Retrieval)The Vault is Hearthlinkƒ?Ts encrypted, persistent memory spine. It enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) without third-party cloud indexes.Encryption: Secured via AES-256 with per-record keys and tamper-evident audit logs.Hybrid Search Strategy:CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation): Interaction history (<1ms latency).Memory Slices: Active persona context (~10ms latency).Vector Store: ChromaDB using MiniLM-L6-v2 SentenceTransformers (384-dim vectors) for semantic recall (~100ms latency).Structured Indexing: SQLite-backed keyword indexing for high-precision filtering by tags, persona source, and timestamps.3. Persona Orchestration: The Multi-Agent SystemHearthlink is not a monolithic chatbot; it is a multi-agent coordination layer managed by the Core module.Alden (The Executive): The productivity engine. Alden handles task management and high-level reasoning, pulling from the Vault to align with user goals.Alice (The Contextual Analyst): A behavioral specialist designed with neurodivergent support in mind. Alice monitors sentiment, pace, and interaction patterns to suggest interventions before user burnout.Mimic (The Specialist Engine): An extensible \"Meta-Persona\" that allows users to generate bespoke agents (e.g., a \"Research Analyst\" or \"Coding Help\") on the fly.Sentry (The Guardian): The security watchdog. Sentry monitors external integrations via the Synapse gateway, flagging policy violations in plain language.4. Scientific Grounding & Behavioral ValidationWe distinguish Hearthlink from \"hallucinatory\" AI by anchoring the Alice persona in established Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research:Cognitive Load Proxy: Aliceƒ?Ts behavioralAnalysisService tracks error rates, response latency, and task-switching frequencyƒ?\"verified markers of cognitive strain.ADHD Support: Features like \"Hyperfocus Nudges\" (interrupting deep-work loops) and \"Daily Check-ins\" (providing executive function scaffolding) are based on ADHD coaching methodologies.Physiological Integration: The system supports opt-in heart rate monitoring to detect stress-induced spikes, prompting Alden to suggest task rescheduling.5. Engineering Roadmap: The Path to BetaVault Integration: Finalizing the bridge between the long-term vector store and Aldenƒ?Ts response generation to eliminate context-loss.Compliance Tooling: Mapping existing audit logs to GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 frameworks to prepare for enterprise adoption.Predictive Intelligence: Implementing a temporal analysis layer to forecast \"Focus Drops\" and suggest breaks based on historical usage patterns.External Audit: Engaging a third-party security firm to conduct a penetration test on the Vault and the Synapse plugin sandbox.6. Business Model & FinancialsSeed Round Ask: $700K ƒ?\" $1MRunway: 12ƒ?\"15 months.Allocation: 70% Engineering (3-person dev team), 10% Security Audits, 10% GTM, 10% Contingency.The Economic EdgeBecause Hearthlink runs on user hardware, our Gross Margin is ƒ%^90%. We shift the heaviest cost of AIƒ?\"inferenceƒ?\"from our balance sheet to the userƒ?Ts device.Enterprise: $50ƒ?\"$100/user/year (Private SaaS model).Consumer: One-time perpetual license ($99) or \"Privacy-as-a-Product\" subscription ($5ƒ?\"$10/mo).7.

The Vault: Local Memory & RAG Schema\r\nThe Vault serves as the structural foundation of the system, acting as an encrypted memory spine that creates a powerful retention loop1111.\r\nVector Database (Semantic Search)Hearthlink utilizes ChromaDB as the embedded vector store.\r\nEmbeddings: Text is vectorized via the MiniLM-L6-v2 model, producing 384-dimensional vectors.\r\nLatency: Retrieval is tiered to ensure low-latency performance:\r\nCAG (Cache-Augmented Generation): Recent interactions (<1 ms).Active \r\nMemory Slices: Persona-specific context (~10 ms).\r\nFull Vector Search: Semantic recall (~100 ms).Relational Schema (Structured Metadata)To enable precision filtering by persona and time, Hearthlink maintains a local SQLite keyword index.TableKey ColumnsPurposeMemoriesid, content, timestamp, classification_levelCore encrypted record storage.Persona_Contextpersona_id, memory_id, relevance_scoreLinks specific memories to Alden, Alice, Mimic, or Sentry.Audit_Logsaction_id, actor_persona, resource_accessed, hashTamper-evident logs for security auditing by Sentry.\r\nII. Persona Orchestration & Internal API\r\nHearthlink is structured as a multi-agent system coordinated by the Core module, or \"communication switch\".\r\nCoordination Protocol\r\nThe personaCommunicationService manages inter-agent messaging via internal APIs rather than LLM inference to ensure reliability.\r\nDirect Routing: Core routes prompts based on defined triggers and rules rather than a black-box router model.\r\nMulti-Agent Sessions: Users can create \"rooms\" where multiple personas participate in a roundtable discussion; each message is explicitly attributed to the persona that spoke it.\r\nIntervention Logic: If Alice detects high stress, she sends a structured alert to the Core, which then prompts Alden to suggest a workflow adjustment.\r\nMimic Engine: Dynamic Agent DeploymentUnlike static wrappers, Mimic is a versatile engine used to define, store, and deploy custom agents2222.\r\nAgent Bespoking: Users can generate specialized assistants (e.g., \"Project Researcher\") on the fly.\r\nPersona Forking: The API supports \"forking\" and \"merging\" personas to allow users to experiment with different specialized skill sets safely.\r\nIII. Behavioral Analysis Pipeline\r\nThe Alice persona's analysis is grounded in physiological and interaction-based signals processed locally.\r\nMetric Monitoring: The behavioralAnalysisService monitors quantitative signals, including typing speed, error rates, and response latency.Focus Decline Pattern: If the system detects a high error rate combined with prolonged task time, Alice flags a focus decline and recommends a break.\r\nHyperfocus Logic: Alice recognizes \"hyperfocus\" patternsƒ?\"intense focus common in neurodivergent usersƒ?\"and provides external reminders or enforced breaks to prevent executive dysfunction.\r\nStructural Privacy: All behavioral insights are stored in the local Vault; Alice maintains a \"neurodivergence profile\" that updates over time without ever leaving the user's device.\r\nIV. Inference Economics & SecurityCOGS Reduction: By leveraging local hardware, Hearthlink eliminates the primary Cost of Goods Sold for enterprises, as inference accounts for two-thirds of all AI compute in 20263.\r\nVault Security: Records are encrypted at rest with AES-256 and labeled by classification level.\r\nAudit Exports: For enterprise compliance, Sentry's audit logs can be exported to external SIEM systems while keeping the underlying data local.\r\n"}}

She requires intense focus, specialized research, and strict data security.\r\n\r\n08:30 AM | Strategic Alignment (The Executive)\r\nJane opens Hearthlink to organize her morning. Unlike a standard chatbot, she is met by Alden, her primary partner for high-level reasoning and task delegation.\r\n\r\nThe Interaction: Alden retrieves Jane's launch goals from the Vaultƒ?\"the system's local, encrypted memory spine.\r\n\r\nThe Value: Because the Vault uses structural trust to adapt to Jane's unique cognitive patterns, Alden suggests a schedule that prioritizes her most complex reasoning tasks during her peak morning hours. Jane maintains Economic Agency because this intelligence runs on her own hardware, avoiding \"compute taxes\".\r\n\r\n11:45 AM | Cognitive Fatigue Detection (The Support)\r\nAfter three hours of intense back-to-back planning, Janeƒ?Ts interaction patterns show signs of strain. Alice detects rising cognitive load.\r\n\r\nThe Interaction: Alice provides emotional grounding and intervenes with pacing exercises designed to ease the cognitive burden before Jane reaches a breaking point.\r\n\r\nThe Value: Instead of pushing for corporate metrics, Hearthlink ensures technology serves the human cadence. This \"human-adaptive\" approach prevents the burnout common in high-pressure roles.\r\n\r\n02:15 PM | Deep-Dive Technical Research (The Specialist)\r\nJane needs to analyze a competitorƒ?Ts proprietary technical filing. She triggers Mimic, the versatile engine used to deploy custom agents.\r\n\r\nThe Interaction: Jane instantiates a \"Technical Researcher\" persona via Mimic to execute specialized tasks. This specialist joins a CORE group dialogue with Alden to cross-reference the new data with Janeƒ?Ts existing project notes.\r\n\r\nThe Value: All analysis remains within the system-wide imperative of Data Sovereignty. No sensitive IP is uploaded to a cloud, structurally removing the risk of a catastrophic data leak.\r\n\r\n04:30 PM | Digital Border Protection (The Guardian)\r\nWhile Jane is integrating the research, a third-party plugin attempts to access an unauthorized network port to \"verify updates.\" Sentry immediately intercepts the request.\r\n\r\nThe Interaction: Sentry acts as the voice of system security, explaining the specific risk to Jane in plain language. It ensures Jane remains the ultimate authority over her digital borders.\r\n\r\nThe Value: This provides the governance that CISOs require, preventing the \"Shadow AI\" breaches that accounted for 20% of reported leaks in 2025.\r\n\r\nInvestment Summary: The \"Sovereign AI\" Edge\r\nThis walkthrough demonstrates why Hearthlink is the private infrastructure for the next generation of work. By 2026, where AI PCs make up 54.7% of shipments, Hearthlink leverages this local power to turn AI into a system the user truly owns.\r\n"}}

(file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Alice â€” Behavioral Analysis & Context-Awareness\r\n626:**Role:** Behavioral profile builder, empathy/context validator, and conversation coach for Alden (never a task manager or disruptor). Evolves through learning user nuanceâ€”cadence, tone, and patterns in communication.\r\n631:- Offers communication strategy guidance to Alden (\"Be more direct today,\" \"Use supportive language\").\r\n640:- **Backend:** Vault integration (persona-specific meta-data, correction logs), all data user-controlled and opt-in.\r\n645:## **Persona Memory Slice Schema (per user, per Alice)**\r\n672:      \"note\": \"Alice, don't flag for apologies.\",\r\n683:  \"audit_log\": [{ \"action\": \"correction\", \"by\": \"user\", \"timestamp\": \"...\" }]\r\n687:- **Storage:** Encrypted per-user, per-persona in Vault.\r\n695:- `POST /api/vault/persona-memory/alice` â€” Create or update Alice's meta-data (full schema)\r\n697:- `GET /api/vault/persona-memory/alice/export` â€” Export all Alice data for user review/audit\r\n699:- `GET /api/vault/persona-memory/alice/:id/audit` â€” Retrieve correction/annotation log\r\n702:**All endpoints enforce role/attribute permissions and are fully auditable.**\r\n709:type AlicePersonaProps = {\r\n725:  onMetricUpdate: (metrics: Partial<AliceMetrics>) => void;\r\n728:  auditLog: AuditEvent[];\r\n734:- UI surfaces all teachability/correction opportunities with full audit trail.\r\n742:- **Policy:** Only user can annotate or reset any data; Alice's own evolution is limited to meta-data, never core user memory.

Vault â€” Persona-Aware Secure Memory Store\r\n920:Local, encrypted, persona-locked memory for all agents, supporting both siloed and (user-authorized) shared memory. Vault enforces a strict zero-trust policy: no cross-persona access occurs without explicit user mediation and a full audit trail. Every persona's memory is segregated, structured, and exportable, with schema evolution and migration tools for future-proofing.\r\n927:  Each agent (Alden, Alice, Mimic, etc.) has its own memory slice schema, defined by its unique contract.

They receive a Vault-managed capsule scoped to a single task or session purpose.\r\n1026:  Capsule contents are not merged into Vault slices or communal memory without explicit user approval via Sentry review.\r\n1050:  Core only facilitates connectionsâ€”never accesses or mutates persona memory directly (see Vault for cross-persona policy).\r\n1055:  External agents (via Synapse) are shown as equal participants, but can only join/leave at user direction.\\\r\n1056:  All external engagement is fully logged and auditable.\r\n1070:`{ \"room_id\": \"core-002\", \"created_by\": \"user-123\", \"created_at\": \"2025-07-06T14:00:00Z\", \"topic\": \"Research Planning\", \"participants\": [ {\"type\": \"persona\", \"id\": \"alden\"}, {\"type\": \"persona\", \"id\": \"alice\"}, {\"type\": \"external\", \"id\": \"bob-research-bot\"} ], \"session_log\": [ { \"event\": \"join\", \"agent_id\": \"alden\", \"timestamp\": \"...\" }, { \"event\": \"response\", \"agent_id\": \"alice\", \"content\": \"Here's a summary of sentiment...\", \"timestamp\": \"...\" } ], \"breakouts\": [ { \"breakout_id\": \"core-002-1\", \"topic\": \"AI Ethics\", \"participants\": [\"alice\", \"bob-research-bot\"], \"log\": [] } ], \"live_feed_settings\": { \"verbosity\": \"default\", \"hidden_responses\": [\"alden-draft-2\"] }, \"audit_log\": [ {\"action\": \"agent_added\", \"by\": \"user\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"} ] }`\r\n1083:**All endpoints require user authentication/authorization and are logged/audited.**\r\n1095:`type CoreSessionProps = { roomId: string topic: string participants: Participant[] sessionLog: SessionEvent[] breakouts: BreakoutRoom[] liveFeedSettings: LiveFeedSettings onParticipantChange: (participants: Participant[]) => void onBreakoutCreate: (breakout: BreakoutRoom) => void onLogExport: () => void onSessionEnd: () => void auditLog: AuditEvent[] }`\r\n1099:  All controls must be accessible and export actions trigger confirmations and audit log entries.\r\n1115:  - Core cannot access or mutate persona memoryâ€”must use MCP/Vault for data handoff.\r\n1144:## 6. Synapse â€” Secure External Gateway & Protocol Boundary\r\n1147:Sole orchestrator and gatekeeper for all inbound/outbound traffic between Hearthlink, plugins, external LLMs, APIs, and web resources. Synapse enforces protocol boundaries, logs and mediates all traffic, and provides policy-driven controls for plugin sandboxing, manifest enforcement, and multi-system onboarding.\\\r\n1148:All external access, plugin execution, and agent communications flow through Synapse and are routed through Core for context/logging.\r\n1155:  All web/API/plugin/external traffic enters and exits via Synapse.\\\r\n1159:  User approves/disapproves each new plugin/connection, triggering audit trail and risk scoring.\r\n1164:  Synapse enforces resource constraints, permission boundaries, and termination policies.\r\n1179:`{ \"plugin_id\": \"summarizer-v2\", \"name\": \"Summarizer\", \"version\": \"2.0.1\", \"requested_permissions\": [\"read_documents\", \"write_notes\"], \"sandbox\": true, \"risk_score\": 12, \"approved_by_user\": true, \"manifest_signature\": \"sha256:...\", \"benchmarks\": { \"avg_response_ms\": 430, \"error_rate\": 0.01 }, \"audit_log\": [ {\"event\": \"approved\", \"by\": \"user\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}, {\"event\": \"benchmark\", \"score\": 15, \"timestamp\": \"...\"} ] }`\r\n1186:- `POST /api/synapse/plugin/approve` â€” User approves/declines manifest (triggers audit log, risk scoring).\r\n1194:**All endpoints are audited, and every plugin/connection change triggers user notification and log entry.**\r\n1206:`type SynapsePluginProps = { pluginId: string name: string version: string requestedPermissions: string[] sandbox: boolean riskScore: number approvedByUser: boolean manifestSignature: string benchmarks: BenchmarkResults auditLog: AuditEvent[] onApprove: () => void onRevoke: () => void onBenchmark: () => void onPermissionsUpdate: (permissions: string[]) => void }`\r\n1227:  - Synapse enforces sandboxing/isolationâ€”never runs plugin in-process.\r\n1237:  External agents can only write to their own Vault capsule; all other writes are denied.\r\n1239:  External write requests are stored in a quarantine ledger for review.

The \"Hearth Table\" Roundtable\r\n\r\nA circular multi-agent interface where:\r\n\r\n- Participant avatars **glow** based on active speaking states.\r\n- **Threads of Fate**: Visual lines showing context flow and message routing between personas.\r\n- **Side Chambers**: Floating panels where agents can be \"dragged/dropped\" in and out of active breakouts.\r\n\r\n### 3. Session & Breakout Dynamics\r\n\r\n- **Breakout Room Orchestration**: Specialized isolated discussion groups (e.g., \"Medical Ethics Sub-group\") with automatic insight merging back to the main Hearth Table.\r\n- **Structured Turn-Taking**: Configurable patterns (Round Robin, Manual Override, Skip Inactive) with 30s timeouts to maintain conversational momentum.\r\n- **Communal Memory Exchange**: Cross-agent insight sharing protocols where agents broadcast \"Observations\" and \"Interaction Patterns\" to a shared session buffer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## II. Cognitive Enhancement Engine (The \"Hearth\" Logic)\r\n\r\n_Source: ALICE_MIMIC_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md, TEMPORAL_INTELLIGENCE_BENCHMARK.md_\r\n\r\n### 1. Psychological Signal Math (Alice's Core)\r\n\r\nThresholds for detecting user states in real-time:\r\n\r\n- **Focus Signal (0-100)**: `60.0 + 25.0 * (completion_ratio - 0.5) - 6.0 * interruptions - 4.0 * context_switches`.\r\n- **Stress Signal (0-100)**: `50.0 + 8.0 * interruptions + 6.0 * context_switches - 15.0 * sentiment`.\r\n- **Cognitive Load**: Calculated based on task complexity vs. completion speed.\r\n\r\n### 2. Temporal Intelligence Patterns\r\n\r\n- **Energy Crash Prediction**: Predicting \"3pm slumps\" 30-60 minutes in advance and suggesting: _\"This is complex work. Want to defer it to 10am tomorrow when you're usually most focused?\"_\r\n- **Stress Receptivity Model**: Alice monitors for \"Receptivity Windows\" (low stress periods) before delivering challenging feedback or performance critiques.\r\n- **Time Pressure Language**: Detects phrases like \"I can't handle the pressure\" to trigger immediate schedule-decongestion protocols.\r\n\r\n### 3. Intelligence Benchmarks (The Standard)\r\n\r\n- **Temporal Reasoning Accuracy**: Target 85% accuracy with <5s processing time for complex scheduling conflicts.\r\n- **Optimization Score**: Target >80% for auto-generated schedules containing 10,000+ data points.\r\n- **Voice activity detection**: High-fidelity pattern recognition to filter ambient noise during voice command processing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## III.

Visual Design Philosophy\r\n\r\n- **Visual Silence (Zen Mode)**: A high-contrast, minimalist layout that strips away all \"Brag Metrics\" during Deep Work sessions.\r\n- **Immersive Mode**: A full-screen interface (toggled by ESC) featuring a star-field parallax background (`stars.png`) that moves with the mouse.\r\n- **Floating Stardust**: Alice's coach hints appear as ephemeral particles that softly dissolve, rather than static notification \"toasts.\"\r\n\r\n### 2. Micro-Interactions\r\n\r\n- **The \"Key of Destiny\"**: A high-fidelity gold key animation for Vault export/purge actions.\r\n- **Insight Pool**: Alice's trend graphs animate over a liquid \"insight pool\" background.\r\n- **Focus Bloom**: A visual \"bloom\" effect on the UI when 25 minutes of focus are achieved without distraction.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## IV. Persona Evolution & Management\r\n\r\n_Source: ALICE_MIMIC_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md, Conversational_Persona_Creation.md_\r\n\r\n### 1. Performance Tier Classification\r\n\r\nPersonas evolve through usage tiers based on average score and success rate:\r\n\r\n- **Excellent (Tier 5)**: >90 score, >95% success, >20 records. (Production Ready)\r\n- **Stable (Tier 4)**: >80 score, >90% success, >10 records.\r\n- **Beta / Risky / Unstable**: Lower tiers requiring more training or correction.\r\n\r\n### 2. Specialized Persona Roles\r\n\r\nBlueprint configurations for specialized support:\r\n\r\n- **Health Advisor**: Caring but cautious guidance (not medical advice).\r\n- **Financial Advisor**: Educational and responsible budgeting support.\r\n- **Technical Specialist**: Precision-focused software development help.\r\n- **Creative Director**: Innovation and brainstorming-focused.\r\n\r\n### 3. Conversational Persona Creation\r\n\r\n- **Natural language patterns**: Spin-up triggers like _\"Clone Alden as a technical support specialist\"_ or _\"Make Alice more creative and less formal.\"_\r\n- **Trait Extraction Engine**: Automated mapping of keywords (e.g., \"high precision\") to numerical trait values (e.g., precision: 90) during creation.\r\n- **Meta-Persona Prompting**: Using Mimic to generate the \"Internal Monologue\" and \"Aesthetic Voice\" of new agents on-the-fly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## V. Technical & Infrastructure Blueprints\r\n\r\n_Source: REMAINING_IMPLEMENTATION_WORK.md, PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md, ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md_\r\n\r\n### 1. Security & Resilience\r\n\r\n- **OAuth2 Auto-Refresh**: Implementation using `BasicClient.exchange_refresh_token` with a 5-minute pre-expiry safety buffer.\r\n- **HTML Sanitization**: Using the `ammonia` crate in Rust to safely render emails without XSS risk.\r\n- **Vault ACL**: Granular `vault_access_grants` table (`read`, `write`, `admin` roles) to maintain privacy in multi-persona environments.\r\n- **Plugin Lifecycle Protocol**: Standardized Synapse flow: `Register` -> `Approve` -> `Review` -> `Update` -> `Revoke`.\r\n\r\n### 2. High-Reliability UI Standards\r\n\r\n- **Aria-Live Regions**: Mandatory live regions for status messages to ensure accessibility.\r\n- **Skip Connections**: Semantic \"Skip to main content\" links for keyboard-heavy power users.\r\n- **Performance Budgets**: Target of 60% faster render times than the 2025 baseline via `React.memo` and `useMemo` auditing.\r\n\r\n### 3. Operations & Resilience\r\n\r\n- **Vault Management Ops**: Blueprint for `Full Export`, `Secure Import`, and `Nuclear Purge` (confirmed permanent deletion with 2-step verification).\r\n- **Connection Handshake**: Standardized Synapse handshake protocol with data retention policy enforcement (no_retention default).\r\n\r\n---\r\n"}}

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

By moving the entire AI stackâ€”from the vector database to the LLMâ€”onto consumer hardware, Hearthlink eliminates cloud compute costs, mitigates $10M+ data breach risks, and provides a \"Balanced Team\" of AI personas designed for cognitive dignity and neurodivergent support.The Opportunity: Capitalizing on the $8.5B Agentic AI market and the 54% market penetration of AI PCs in 2026.2. Technical Architecture: The \"Sovereign Stack\"Model Strategy (Quantized On-Device LLMs)Hearthlink operates within a strictly local execution environment, typically constrained to â‰ˆ8GB RAM. We utilize the Ollama engine to manage a rotation of high-capability, small-scale models:Primary Models: LLaMA 3.x (8B) and Mistral 7B, typically in 4-bit format (~3â€“5GB footprint).Performance: A 3B model yields 1â€“3 second response times on standard CPUs; 7â€“8B models are utilized for higher-accuracy reasoning tasks.Caching & Backend: The system maintains a default 4GB memory cache and can fall back to GPT4All or llama.cpp backends to ensure cross-hardware compatibility.Zero-Data Outbound: No inference data ever leaves the device, providing structural privacy and eliminating marginal compute costs.\"Vault\" RAG Architecture (Local Memory & Low-Latency Retrieval)The Vault is Hearthlinkâ€™s encrypted, persistent memory spine. It enables Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) without third-party cloud indexes.Encryption: Secured via AES-256 with per-record keys and tamper-evident audit logs.Hybrid Search Strategy:CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation): Interaction history (<1ms latency).Memory Slices: Active persona context (~10ms latency).Vector Store: ChromaDB using MiniLM-L6-v2 SentenceTransformers (384-dim vectors) for semantic recall (~100ms latency).Structured Indexing: SQLite-backed keyword indexing for high-precision filtering by tags, persona source, and timestamps.3. Persona Orchestration: The Multi-Agent SystemHearthlink is not a monolithic chatbot; it is a multi-agent coordination layer managed by the Core module.Alden (The Executive): The productivity engine. Alden handles task management and high-level reasoning, pulling from the Vault to align with user goals.Alice (The Contextual Analyst): A behavioral specialist designed with neurodivergent support in mind. Alice monitors sentiment, pace, and interaction patterns to suggest interventions before user burnout.Mimic (The Specialist Engine): An extensible \"Meta-Persona\" that allows users to generate bespoke agents (e.g., a \"Research Analyst\" or \"Coding Help\") on the fly.Sentry (The Guardian): The security watchdog. Sentry monitors external integrations via the Synapse gateway, flagging policy violations in plain language.4. Scientific Grounding & Behavioral ValidationWe distinguish Hearthlink from \"hallucinatory\" AI by anchoring the Alice persona in established Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research:Cognitive Load Proxy: Aliceâ€™s behavioralAnalysisService tracks error rates, response latency, and task-switching frequencyâ€”verified markers of cognitive strain.ADHD Support: Features like \"Hyperfocus Nudges\" (interrupting deep-work loops) and \"Daily Check-ins\" (providing executive function scaffolding) are based on ADHD coaching methodologies.Physiological Integration: The system supports opt-in heart rate monitoring to detect stress-induced spikes, prompting Alden to suggest task rescheduling.5. Engineering Roadmap: The Path to BetaVault Integration: Finalizing the bridge between the long-term vector store and Aldenâ€™s response generation to eliminate context-loss.Compliance Tooling: Mapping existing audit logs to GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 frameworks to prepare for enterprise adoption.Predictive Intelligence: Implementing a temporal analysis layer to forecast \"Focus Drops\" and suggest breaks based on historical usage patterns.External Audit: Engaging a third-party security firm to conduct a penetration test on the Vault and the Synapse plugin sandbox.6. Business Model & FinancialsSeed Round Ask: $700K â€“ $1MRunway: 12â€“15 months.Allocation: 70% Engineering (3-person dev team), 10% Security Audits, 10% GTM, 10% Contingency.The Economic EdgeBecause Hearthlink runs on user hardware, our Gross Margin is â‰ˆ90%. We shift the heaviest cost of AIâ€”inferenceâ€”from our balance sheet to the userâ€™s device.Enterprise: $50â€“$100/user/year (Private SaaS model).Consumer: One-time perpetual license ($99) or \"Privacy-as-a-Product\" subscription ($5â€“$10/mo).7.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Human by Design. Local by Default.\n-1. Executive Summary\n-Hearthlink is a local-first AI assistant platform that solves the \"Faustian bargain\" of modern AI: the sacrifice of privacy for productivity. By moving the entire AI stackƒ?\"from the vector database to the LLMƒ?\"onto consumer hardware, Hearthlink eliminates cloud compute costs, mitigates $10M+ data breach risks, and provides a \"Balanced Team\" of AI personas designed for cognitive dignity and neurodivergent support.The Opportunity: Capitalizing on the $8.5B Agentic AI market and the 54% market penetration of AI PCs in 2026.2.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
