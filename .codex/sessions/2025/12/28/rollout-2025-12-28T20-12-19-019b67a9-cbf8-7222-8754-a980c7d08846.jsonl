supports quick switching.\n+- Breadcrumbs in TopBar for Villages > Houses > Rooms; preserves hierarchy.\n+- MasterDetailShell for tablet layouts; reduce mode switches between list and detail.\n+- Floating Action Button (contextual) for \"Enter Village\" or \"Start Play\".\n+\n+## Risks\n+- Route migration: deep links from `src/frontend/App.tsx` will break without redirects.\n+- Page refactors: `src/frontend/pages/Village.tsx` and `src/frontend/pages/HomeInterior.tsx` are large; splitting into shells + detail panes needs careful state migration.\n+- Playroom exposure: `src/frontend/components/PhysicsPlayground.tsx` was hidden; user-facing onboarding and safety gates required.\n+- Input patterns: existing gestures in `src/frontend/systems/GestureHandler` may conflict with new swipe navigation.\n*** End Patch"}}
