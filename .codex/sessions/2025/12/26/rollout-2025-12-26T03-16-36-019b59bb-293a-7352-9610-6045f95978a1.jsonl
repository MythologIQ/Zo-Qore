Disable QoreLogic MCP server\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Stop server\r\n   pkill -f qorelogic.py\r\n\r\n   # Verify stopped\r\n   ps aux | grep qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Notify pilot team\r\n   ```markdown\r\n   Subject: QoreLogic Pilot - Temporary Shutdown\r\n\r\n   We've temporarily disabled QoreLogic due to [issue].\r\n   Your workflow is unaffected - proceed without QoreLogic.\r\n\r\n   We're investigating and will provide updates every 2 hours.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Document failure mode\r\n   ```markdown\r\n   # Rollback Incident\r\n\r\n   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\r\n   **Trigger:** [What caused rollback]\r\n   **Impact:** [Who/what was affected]\r\n   **Status:** Investigating\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Phase 2: Analysis (1-4 hours)**\r\n1. Review logs and metrics\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Export logs for analysis\r\n   cp logs/qorelogic.log logs/incident_$(date +%Y%m%d).log\r\n\r\n   # Query Prometheus for metrics\r\n   curl -G http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query_range \\\r\n     --data-urlencode 'query=qorelogic_errors_total' \\\r\n     > metrics_export.json\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Identify root cause\r\n3. Assess impact and risk\r\n\r\n**Phase 3: Decision (within 4 hours of rollback)**\r\n\r\n**Option A: Fix Forward**\r\n- If fix is simple (<4 hours)\r\n- High confidence in fix\r\n- No data loss risk\r\n\r\n**Option B: Rollback**\r\n- If complex issue requiring redesign\r\n- Low confidence in quick fix\r\n- Risk of further damage\r\n\r\n**Option C: Partial Rollback**\r\n- Disable specific features\r\n- Keep core system running\r\n- Isolate problematic component\r\n\r\n**Phase 4: Communication**\r\n- Update stakeholders every 2 hours\r\n- Create incident post-mortem\r\n- Schedule retrospective\r\n- Document lessons learned\r\n\r\n### Rollback Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Server stopped\r\n- [ ] Team notified\r\n- [ ] Incident logged\r\n- [ ] Logs exported\r\n- [ ] Metrics captured\r\n- [ ] Root cause identified\r\n- [ ] Decision made (A/B/C)\r\n- [ ] Stakeholders updated\r\n- [ ] Post-mortem scheduled\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Communication Plan\r\n\r\n### Stakeholder Updates\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** Daily during Week 4\r\n\r\n**Recipients:**\r\n- Pilot team\r\n- Engineering leadership\r\n- Product management\r\n- SRE team\r\n\r\n**Format:**\r\n```markdown\r\n# QoreLogic Pilot - Day X Update\r\n\r\n**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\r\n**Status:** dYYЫ Green | dYYн Yellow | dY\"' Red\r\n\r\n## Metrics (Last 24h)\r\n- Uptime: ___%\r\n- Audits Completed: ___\r\n- Incidents: ___ (P0: ___, P1: ___)\r\n- User Satisfaction: ___ / 10\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n- [Key achievement or learning]\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n- [Any blockers or concerns]\r\n\r\n## Next 24h\r\n- [Planned activities]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Delivery:** Slack #qorelogic-pilot channel by 10am daily\r\n\r\n### Incident Communication\r\n\r\n**P0 (Critical):**\r\n- Notify immediately via Slack mention\r\n- Page on-call engineer (Track E)\r\n- Hourly updates until resolved\r\n- Post-mortem within 48h\r\n\r\n**P1 (Warning):**\r\n- Post in #qorelogic-pilot\r\n- Daily updates until resolved\r\n- Post-mortem if user-facing\r\n\r\n**P2/P3:**\r\n- Weekly rollup in usage report\r\n- No real-time alerts\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Risk Matrix\r\n\r\n| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |\r\n|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|\r\n| **Pilot deployment issues** | Medium | High | Extensive Week 3 testing, rollback plan ready |\r\n| **User adoption resistance** | Medium | Medium | Excellent onboarding, UX research upfront |\r\n| **False positive rate in production** | Low | Medium | Heuristics proven in benchmarks, L3 approval safety net |\r\n| **Performance degradation** | Low | Medium | Baselines established, continuous monitoring |\r\n| **Missing edge cases** | Medium | Low | Shadow Genome for failure analysis, rapid iteration |\r\n| **Data corruption** | Very Low | Critical | Merkle chain integrity, daily backups |\r\n| **Security breach** | Very Low | Critical | Ed25519 signatures, audit trail |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Resource Requirements\r\n\r\n### Infrastructure\r\n\r\n**Compute:**\r\n- 1x VM or container (2 CPU, 4GB RAM)\r\n- 10GB storage for ledger database\r\n- Network access to pilot workspace\r\n\r\n**Monitoring:**\r\n- Prometheus server (existing or new)\r\n- Grafana instance (existing or new)\r\n- Slack workspace for alerts\r\n\r\n**Tools:**\r\n- Python 3.9+\r\n- SQLite 3\r\n- Git\r\n- curl, jq for API testing\r\n\r\n### Personnel\r\n\r\n**Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Requirements:**\r\n\r\n| Role | FTE | Duration | Total Hours |\r\n|:-----|:----|:---------|:-----------|\r\n| Platform Engineer | 1.0 | 2 days | 16h |\r\n| SRE Engineer | 0.2 | 7 days | 10h |\r\n| UX Researcher | 0.5 | 3 days | 12h |\r\n| QA Expert | 0.5 | 2 days | 8h |\r\n| Debugger (on-call) | 0.3 | 7 days | Variable |\r\n\r\n**Total Effort:** ~50 hours\r\n\r\n### Budget\r\n\r\n| Item | Cost | Notes |\r\n|:-----|:-----|:------|\r\n| Compute (VM) | $20 | 7 days @ $3/day |\r\n| Monitoring tools | $0 | Using existing infrastructure |\r\n| Survey tool | $0 | Google Forms (free) |\r\n| Slack | $0 | Existing workspace |\r\n| **Total** | **$20** | Minimal infrastructure cost |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Success Definition\r\n\r\nWeek 4 is considered **successful** if:\r\n\r\n### Technical Success\r\n1.

When an alert fires, follow the corresponding playbook immediately.\r\n\r\n## Incident Severity Levels\r\n\r\n| Severity      | Response Time | Notification Channel |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |\r\n| Critical (P0) | < 5 minutes   | PagerDuty / SMS      |\r\n| Warning (P1)  | < 30 minutes  | Slack #incidents     |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Critical Incidents (P0)\r\n\r\n### Playbook: Service Down\r\n\r\n**Alert:** `ServiceDown`  \r\n**Severity:** Critical  \r\n**Trigger:** `up{job=\"qorelogic_server\"} == 0 for 1m`\r\n\r\n#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)\r\n\r\n1. **Verify Service Status**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check if process is running\r\n   ps aux | grep qorelogic\r\n\r\n   # Check service status\r\n   systemctl status qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Check Application Logs**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # View last 50 error logs\r\n   journalctl -u qorelogic -n 50 --no-pager | grep -i error\r\n\r\n   # Or if using file logs\r\n   tail -n 100 /var/log/qorelogic/app.log | grep -i error\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Check System Resources**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check disk space\r\n   df -h\r\n\r\n   # Check memory\r\n   free -h\r\n\r\n   # Check CPU\r\n   top -n 1 | head -20\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n#### Remediation Steps\r\n\r\n**If process crashed:**\r\n\r\n1. Restart the service:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   systemctl restart qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n2. Monitor startup logs for errors:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   journalctl -u qorelogic -f\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**If out of disk space:**\r\n\r\n1. Identify large files:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   du -sh /var/log/qorelogic/* | sort -rh | head -10\r\n   ```\r\n2. Rotate or compress old logs:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**If out of memory (OOM killed):**\r\n\r\n1. Check dmesg for OOM events:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   dmesg | grep -i \"killed process\"\r\n   ```\r\n2. Increase swap or add memory\r\n3. Review memory usage patterns in Grafana\r\n\r\n#### Verification\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Verify service is up\r\ncurl -f http://localhost:8080/health || echo \"Service still down\"\r\n\r\n# Check metrics endpoint\r\ncurl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep up\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Criteria for Resolution:** Service returns HTTP 200 on `/health` endpoint and `up{job=\"qorelogic_server\"}` == 1\r\n\r\n#### Escalation\r\n\r\nIf service does not recover within 10 minutes:\r\n\r\n- Page on-call engineering lead\r\n- Create incident ticket in Jira\r\n- Notify stakeholders via Slack\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Playbook: High Latency\r\n\r\n**Alert:** `HighLatency`  \r\n**Severity:** Critical  \r\n**Trigger:** `P95 audit_latency_seconds > 1.0s for 5m`\r\n\r\n#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)\r\n\r\n1. **Confirm Latency Spike**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check current P95 latency\r\n   curl -s http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep audit_latency_seconds\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Check System Load**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # CPU usage\r\n   top -bn1 | head -20\r\n\r\n   # I/O wait\r\n   iostat -x 1 5\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Check Database Performance**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Active connections\r\n   sqlite3 qorelogic.db \"PRAGMA database_list;\"\r\n\r\n   # Check for long-running queries (if using PostgreSQL)\r\n   # SELECT pid, now() - query_start as duration, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n#### Remediation Steps\r\n\r\n**If high CPU:**\r\n\r\n1. Identify CPU-intensive processes:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10\r\n   ```\r\n2. If audit process is consuming CPU, check for:\r\n   - Regex compilation issues (should be pre-compiled)\r\n   - Infinite loops in heuristic patterns\r\n3. Restart service if necessary:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   systemctl restart qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**If high I/O:**\r\n\r\n1. Check disk I/O:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   iotop -o\r\n   ```\r\n2. If database is bottleneck:\r\n   - Verify indexes exist on `soa_ledger.timestamp` and `soa_ledger.agent_did`\r\n   - Run `ANALYZE` on SQLite database:\r\n     ```bash\r\n     sqlite3 qorelogic.db \"ANALYZE;\"\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n**If high network latency:**\r\n\r\n1. Check network connectivity:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ping -c 10 8.8.8.8\r\n   traceroute 8.8.8.8\r\n   ```\r\n2. Check for external API calls that might be slow\r\n\r\n#### Verification\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Run a test audit\r\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/audit \\\r\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\r\n  -d '{\"code\": \"print(\\\"test\\\")\"}'\r\n\r\n# Verify latency is < 1s\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Criteria for Resolution:** P95 latency < 1.0s sustained for 10 minutes\r\n\r\n#### Escalation\r\n\r\nIf latency does not improve within 15 minutes:\r\n\r\n- Notify performance engineering team\r\n- Review recent code deployments\r\n- Consider traffic throttling if necessary\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Playbook: High Error Rate\r\n\r\n**Alert:** `HighErrorRate`  \r\n**Severity:** Critical  \r\n**Trigger:** `Error rate > 1% for 5m`\r\n\r\n#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)\r\n\r\n1. **Check Error Metrics**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Get error breakdown by verdict\r\n   curl -s http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep audit_total\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Review Recent Error Logs**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Get last 100 error logs\r\n   journalctl -u qorelogic -n 100 --no-pager | grep -i error\r\n\r\n   # Or from file logs\r\n   tail -n 200 /var/log/qorelogic/app.log | jq 'select(.level == \"ERROR\")'\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Check Database Integrity**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # SQLite integrity check\r\n   sqlite3 qorelogic.db \"PRAGMA integrity_check;\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n#### Remediation Steps\r\n\r\n**If database corruption detected:**\r\n\r\n1. Stop the service:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   systemctl stop qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n2. Restore from most recent backup:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cp /backups/qorelogic.db.backup /var/lib/qorelogic/qorelogic.db\r\n   ```\r\n3. Start service:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   systemctl start qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**If application errors:**\r\n\r\n1. Identify error pattern from logs\r\n2. Common issues:\r\n   - **UNIQUE constraint violations:** Check for duplicate DIDs\r\n   - **Regex compilation errors:** Verify regex patterns are valid\r\n   - **Missing dependencies:** Check import errors in logs\r\n3. If recent deployment caused errors:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Rollback to previous version\r\n   git revert HEAD\r\n   systemctl restart qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**If out of resources:**\r\n\r\n1. Check disk space (see Service Down playbook)\r\n2. Check memory (see High Memory playbook)\r\n\r\n#### Verification\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Run 10 test audits and verify all succeed\r\nfor i in {1..10}; do\r\n  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/audit \\\r\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\r\n    -d '{\"code\": \"print(\\\"test\\\")\"}'\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Criteria for Resolution:** Error rate < 1% sustained for 10 minutes\r\n\r\n#### Escalation\r\n\r\nIf error rate does not decrease within 15 minutes:\r\n\r\n- Page on-call engineering lead\r\n- Review recent code changes\r\n- Consider disabling non-critical features\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Warning Incidents (P1)\r\n\r\n### Playbook: High Database Latency\r\n\r\n**Alert:** `HighDatabaseLatency`  \r\n**Severity:** Warning  \r\n**Trigger:** `P95 db_query_duration_seconds > 500ms for 10m`\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n\r\n1. **Check Query Performance**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check slow queries in logs\r\n   grep \"slow query\" /var/log/qorelogic/app.log\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Verify Indexes**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sqlite3 qorelogic.db \"PRAGMA index_list('soa_ledger');\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Run Database Maintenance**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sqlite3 qorelogic.db \"VACUUM;\"\r\n   sqlite3 qorelogic.db \"ANALYZE;\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Criteria for Resolution:** P95 DB latency < 500ms sustained for 15 minutes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Playbook: High Memory Usage\r\n\r\n**Alert:** `HighMemoryUsage`  \r\n**Severity:** Warning  \r\n**Trigger:** `Memory usage > 80% for 15m`\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n\r\n1. **Check Memory Breakdown**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Process memory\r\n   ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10\r\n\r\n   # System memory\r\n   free -h\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Identify Memory Leaks**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check for growing memory over time\r\n   watch -n 10 'ps aux | grep qorelogic'\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Restart Service (if needed)**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   systemctl restart qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Criteria for Resolution:** Memory usage < 80% sustained for 15 minutes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Playbook: High Trust Update Latency\r\n\r\n**Alert:** `HighTrustUpdateLatency`  \r\n**Severity:** Warning  \r\n**Trigger:** `P95 trust_update_duration_seconds > 200ms for 10m`\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n\r\n1. **Check Trust Score Calculation**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Review trust update logs\r\n   grep \"trust_update\" /var/log/qorelogic/app.log | tail -50\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Verify Trust Score Cache**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check if LRU cache is effective\r\n   # Review code for functools.lru_cache usage\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Restart Service (if needed)**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   systemctl restart qorelogic\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Criteria for Resolution:** P95 trust update latency < 200ms sustained for 15 minutes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Playbook: Low Audit Throughput\r\n\r\n**Alert:** `LowAuditThroughput`  \r\n**Severity:** Warning  \r\n**Trigger:** `Rate < 0.1 req/s for 15m`\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n\r\n1. **Check if Service is Idle**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check request metrics\r\n   curl -s http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep audit_total\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Verify Service Health**\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   curl http://localhost:8080/health\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Check for Queue Backlog** (if using message queue)\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check queue depth\r\n   # (implementation-specific)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Note:** Low throughput may be normal during off-peak hours.

It specifies how alerts are classified, routed to appropriate teams, and escalated based on severity and duration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Alert Severity Levels\r\n\r\n### P0 - Critical (Immediate Action Required)\r\n\r\n**Definition:** Service is down or severely degraded, impacting all users.\r\n\r\n**Response Time:** < 5 minutes  \r\n**Escalation:** Immediate page to on-call engineer  \r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n- ServiceDown: QoreLogic service is completely unavailable\r\n- HighLatency: P95 latency > 1.0s for 5+ minutes\r\n- HighErrorRate: Error rate > 1% for 5+ minutes\r\n\r\n### P1 - High Priority (Urgent Attention Required)\r\n\r\n**Definition:** Service is degraded but partially functional, impacting significant user base.\r\n\r\n**Response Time:** < 30 minutes  \r\n**Escalation:** Slack notification to platform team  \r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n- HighDatabaseLatency: DB P95 latency > 500ms for 10+ minutes\r\n- HighMemoryUsage: Memory > 80% for 15+ minutes\r\n- HighTrustUpdateLatency: Trust update P95 > 200ms for 10+ minutes\r\n\r\n### P2 - Medium Priority (Attention Required)\r\n\r\n**Definition:** Service is functional but showing warning signs, potential future impact.\r\n\r\n**Response Time:** < 2 hours  \r\n**Escalation:** Daily standup discussion  \r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n- LowAuditThroughput: Throughput < 0.1 req/s for 15+ minutes\r\n- Gradual performance degradation\r\n- Resource usage trending upward\r\n\r\n### P3 - Low Priority (Informational)\r\n\r\n**Definition:** Informational alerts for monitoring purposes, no immediate action required.\r\n\r\n**Response Time:** Next business day  \r\n**Escalation:** Weekly review  \r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n- Scheduled maintenance reminders\r\n- Capacity planning warnings\r\n- Performance trend analysis\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Alert Routing Matrix\r\n\r\n| Alert Name             | Severity | Primary Team | Secondary Team | Channel                | Escalation Path                  |\r\n| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |\r\n| ServiceDown            | P0       | Platform     | DevOps         | PagerDuty              | On-call ƒ+' Engineering Lead ƒ+' CTO |\r\n| HighLatency            | P0       | Platform     | Performance    | PagerDuty              | On-call ƒ+' Engineering Lead ƒ+' CTO |\r\n| HighErrorRate          | P0       | Platform     | DevOps         | PagerDuty              | On-call ƒ+' Engineering Lead ƒ+' CTO |\r\n| HighDatabaseLatency    | P1       | Platform     | DBA            | Slack #alerts-platform | Team Lead ƒ+' Engineering Manager  |\r\n| HighMemoryUsage        | P1       | Platform     | DevOps         | Slack #alerts-platform | Team Lead ƒ+' Engineering Manager  |\r\n| HighTrustUpdateLatency | P1       | Platform     | Trust Team     | Slack #alerts-platform | Team Lead ƒ+' Engineering Manager  |\r\n| LowAuditThroughput     | P2       | Platform     | Product        | Slack #alerts-platform | Daily Standup                    |\r\n| DiskSpaceWarning       | P2       | DevOps       | Platform       | Slack #alerts-devops   | Team Lead                        |\r\n| BackupFailure          | P1       | DevOps       | Platform       | Slack #alerts-devops   | Team Lead ƒ+' Engineering Manager  |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## On-Call Rotation\r\n\r\n### Primary On-Call\r\n\r\n**Schedule:** Weekly rotation, Monday 00:00 UTC to Sunday 23:59 UTC  \r\n**Handoff:** Sunday 23:00 UTC -
