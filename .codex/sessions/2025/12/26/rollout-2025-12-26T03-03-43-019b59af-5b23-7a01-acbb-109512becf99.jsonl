Building on Week 3's successful observability implementation and performance baselining, we will now deploy QoreLogic to a pilot workspace for real-world validation.\r\n\r\n**Week 3 Achievements:**\r\n- Гo. Observability stack complete (structured logging, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboard)\r\n- Гo. Performance baselines established (all targets exceeded by 4-100x)\r\n- Гo. Incident response playbooks and SLO definitions created\r\n- Гo. 132/144 tests passing (91.7% pass rate)\r\n- Гo. Technical debt resolved\r\n\r\n**Week 4 Objectives:**\r\n1. Deploy QoreLogic to an internal pilot workspace\r\n2. Monitor real-world usage for 7 consecutive days\r\n3. Collect user feedback and identify pain points\r\n4. Fix critical bugs and performance issues\r\n5. Validate acceptance criteria in production\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Success Criteria\r\n\r\nWeek 4 is successful when ALL of the following are met:\r\n\r\n| Criterion | Target | Measurement Method |\r\n|:----------|:-------|:------------------|\r\n| **Deployment Stability** | Г%Э99% uptime (7 days) | Prometheus metrics |\r\n| **Performance** | P95 latency <1s | Real-time dashboard |\r\n| **Accuracy** | Catch rate Г%Э95% | Manual audit review |\r\n| **User Satisfaction** | Г%Э7/10 on survey | Post-week survey |\r\n| **Incident Management** | Zero P0 incidents | Incident log |\r\n| **Feedback Quality** | Г%Э10 actionable items | User interviews |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Parallel Track Architecture\r\n\r\nWeek 4 operates with **4 concurrent tracks** plus a reactive on-call track:\r\n\r\n```\r\nГ\"OГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?\r\nГ\",                         WEEK 4 TRACKS                            Г\",\r\nГ\"oГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"кГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"кГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"кГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"кГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"\u000f\r\nГ\",   TRACK A    Г\",   TRACK B    Г\",   TRACK C    Г\",   TRACK D    Г\", OPS Г\",\r\nГ\",  Deployment  Г\",  Monitoring  Г\",    User      Г\",  Test Suite  Г\",     Г\",\r\nГ\",  (Platform)  Г\",    (SRE)     Г\",  Feedback    Г\",   (QA)       Г\",     Г\",\r\nГ\",              Г\",              Г\",   (UX)       Г\",              Г\",     Г\",\r\nГ\"oГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"мГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"мГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"мГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"мГ\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"\u000f\r\nГ\", Day 1-2      Г\", Day 1-7      Г\", Day 3-5      Г\", Day 1-2      Г\", 24/7Г\",\r\nГ\", Sequential   Г\", Continuous   Г\", Mid-week     Г\", Pre-deploy   Г\",     Г\",\r\nГ\"\"Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"'Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"'Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"'Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"'Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"?Г\"~\r\n                                    Г+\"\r\n                            Reactive Track E\r\n                         Bug Fixes (Debugger)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Track A: Deployment (Platform Engineering)\r\n\r\n**Agent:** `platform-engineer`\r\n**Duration:** Day 1-2 (12 hours)\r\n**Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)\r\n**Status:** dY\"< Ready\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\n\r\n1.

Identify root cause\r\n3. Assess impact and risk\r\n\r\n**Phase 3: Decision (within 4 hours of rollback)**\r\n\r\n**Option A: Fix Forward**\r\n- If fix is simple (<4 hours)\r\n- High confidence in fix\r\n- No data loss risk\r\n\r\n**Option B: Rollback**\r\n- If complex issue requiring redesign\r\n- Low confidence in quick fix\r\n- Risk of further damage\r\n\r\n**Option C: Partial Rollback**\r\n- Disable specific features\r\n- Keep core system running\r\n- Isolate problematic component\r\n\r\n**Phase 4: Communication**\r\n- Update stakeholders every 2 hours\r\n- Create incident post-mortem\r\n- Schedule retrospective\r\n- Document lessons learned\r\n\r\n### Rollback Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Server stopped\r\n- [ ] Team notified\r\n- [ ] Incident logged\r\n- [ ] Logs exported\r\n- [ ] Metrics captured\r\n- [ ] Root cause identified\r\n- [ ] Decision made (A/B/C)\r\n- [ ] Stakeholders updated\r\n- [ ] Post-mortem scheduled\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Communication Plan\r\n\r\n### Stakeholder Updates\r\n\r\n**Frequency:** Daily during Week 4\r\n\r\n**Recipients:**\r\n- Pilot team\r\n- Engineering leadership\r\n- Product management\r\n- SRE team\r\n\r\n**Format:**\r\n```markdown\r\n# QoreLogic Pilot - Day X Update\r\n\r\n**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD\r\n**Status:** dYYЫ Green | dYYн Yellow | dY\"' Red\r\n\r\n## Metrics (Last 24h)\r\n- Uptime: ___%\r\n- Audits Completed: ___\r\n- Incidents: ___ (P0: ___, P1: ___)\r\n- User Satisfaction: ___ / 10\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n- [Key achievement or learning]\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n- [Any blockers or concerns]\r\n\r\n## Next 24h\r\n- [Planned activities]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Delivery:** Slack #qorelogic-pilot channel by 10am daily\r\n\r\n### Incident Communication\r\n\r\n**P0 (Critical):**\r\n- Notify immediately via Slack mention\r\n- Page on-call engineer (Track E)\r\n- Hourly updates until resolved\r\n- Post-mortem within 48h\r\n\r\n**P1 (Warning):**\r\n- Post in #qorelogic-pilot\r\n- Daily updates until resolved\r\n- Post-mortem if user-facing\r\n\r\n**P2/P3:**\r\n- Weekly rollup in usage report\r\n- No real-time alerts\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Risk Matrix\r\n\r\n| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |\r\n|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|\r\n| **Pilot deployment issues** | Medium | High | Extensive Week 3 testing, rollback plan ready |\r\n| **User adoption resistance** | Medium | Medium | Excellent onboarding, UX research upfront |\r\n| **False positive rate in production** | Low | Medium | Heuristics proven in benchmarks, L3 approval safety net |\r\n| **Performance degradation** | Low | Medium | Baselines established, continuous monitoring |\r\n| **Missing edge cases** | Medium | Low | Shadow Genome for failure analysis, rapid iteration |\r\n| **Data corruption** | Very Low | Critical | Merkle chain integrity, daily backups |\r\n| **Security breach** | Very Low | Critical | Ed25519 signatures, audit trail |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Resource Requirements\r\n\r\n### Infrastructure\r\n\r\n**Compute:**\r\n- 1x VM or container (2 CPU, 4GB RAM)\r\n- 10GB storage for ledger database\r\n- Network access to pilot workspace\r\n\r\n**Monitoring:**\r\n- Prometheus server (existing or new)\r\n- Grafana instance (existing or new)\r\n- Slack workspace for alerts\r\n\r\n**Tools:**\r\n- Python 3.9+\r\n- SQLite 3\r\n- Git\r\n- curl, jq for API testing\r\n\r\n### Personnel\r\n\r\n**Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Requirements:**\r\n\r\n| Role | FTE | Duration | Total Hours |\r\n|:-----|:----|:---------|:-----------|\r\n| Platform Engineer | 1.0 | 2 days | 16h |\r\n| SRE Engineer | 0.2 | 7 days | 10h |\r\n| UX Researcher | 0.5 | 3 days | 12h |\r\n| QA Expert | 0.5 | 2 days | 8h |\r\n| Debugger (on-call) | 0.3 | 7 days | Variable |\r\n\r\n**Total Effort:** ~50 hours\r\n\r\n### Budget\r\n\r\n| Item | Cost | Notes |\r\n|:-----|:-----|:------|\r\n| Compute (VM) | $20 | 7 days @ $3/day |\r\n| Monitoring tools | $0 | Using existing infrastructure |\r\n| Survey tool | $0 | Google Forms (free) |\r\n| Slack | $0 | Existing workspace |\r\n| **Total** | **$20** | Minimal infrastructure cost |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Success Definition\r\n\r\nWeek 4 is considered **successful** if:\r\n\r\n### Technical Success\r\n1.
