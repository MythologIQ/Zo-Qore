Resolution strategy:\r\n   - Type conflicts Г+' Use most strict version, update both\r\n   - State conflicts Г+' Merge schemas, update reducers\r\n   - API conflicts Г+' Version API or agree on contract\r\n   - Asset conflicts Г+' Rename with prefixes\r\n\r\n4. Apply resolution\r\n5. Rerun affected tests\r\n6. Resume agents\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Dependency Violation Detection\r\n```\r\nWhen agent tries to use incomplete dependency:\r\n\r\n1. Detect violation (e.g., Track 1B using selectors before Track 1A creates them)\r\n2. Pause dependent agent\r\n3. Accelerate dependency track (increase priority)\r\n4. Notify orchestrator\r\n5. Resume when dependency complete\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Timeline & Milestones\r\n\r\n### Week 1: Foundation (Critical Path)\r\n**Days 1-2:**\r\n- Launch Track 1A, 1E, 2A, 2B, 4A\r\n- Set up all 5 workspaces\r\n- Initialize CI/CD (Track 5A)\r\n\r\n**Days 3-5:**\r\n- Monitor critical path progress\r\n- Resolve any early blockers\r\n- Begin Track 1B when 1A complete\r\n- Validate Gate 1 criteria\r\n\r\n**Day 5 Milestone:**\r\n- Foundation complete\r\n- All critical path agents finished\r\n- Quality Gate 1 passed\r\n\r\n### Week 2: Core Features\r\n**Days 6-8:**\r\n- Launch Track 1B, 1C, 1D, 2C, 2D\r\n- Launch Track 3A, 3B\r\n- Continue Track 4A, start Track 4B\r\n\r\n**Days 9-10:**\r\n- Integration testing begins\r\n- First full build with all features\r\n- Resolve integration issues\r\n\r\n**Day 10 Milestone:**\r\n- All core features implemented\r\n- Quality Gate 2 passed\r\n- App functional end-to-end\r\n\r\n### Week 3: Quality & Deployment\r\n**Days 11-14:**\r\n- Launch Track 3C (E2E tests)\r\n- Complete Track 4B (asset optimization)\r\n- Launch Track 5B (deployment)\r\n- Performance optimization\r\n\r\n**Days 15-17:**\r\n- Production deployment\r\n- Smoke testing\r\n- Bug fixes\r\n- Documentation updates\r\n\r\n**Day 17 Milestone:**\r\n- Production launch\r\n- Quality Gate 3 passed\r\n- All agents complete\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Risk Management\r\n\r\n### High-Risk Areas\r\n\r\n**Risk 1: Agent Conflicts**\r\n- **Probability:** Medium\r\n- **Impact:** High\r\n- **Mitigation:** Daily sync, clear workspace boundaries, Gemini conflict resolution\r\n\r\n**Risk 2: Dependency Deadlocks**\r\n- **Probability:** Low\r\n- **Impact:** High\r\n- **Mitigation:** Dependency graph validation, fallback ordering, parallel alternatives\r\n\r\n**Risk 3: Quality Gate Failures**\r\n- **Probability:** Medium\r\n- **Impact:** Medium\r\n- **Mitigation:** Incremental validation, early testing, rollback plans\r\n\r\n**Risk 4: Integration Issues**\r\n- **Probability:** Medium\r\n- **Impact:** Medium\r\n- **Mitigation:** Contract testing, API mocks, incremental integration\r\n\r\n**Risk 5: Timeline Slip**\r\n- **Probability:** Low\r\n- **Impact:** Medium\r\n- **Mitigation:** Parallel tracks, adaptive scheduling, resource reallocation\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Success Metrics\r\n\r\n### Technical Metrics\r\n- Гo.

My focus was on identifying testing gaps, quality assurance process deficiencies, and ensuring test readiness for the 15+ parallel agent tracks across 5 workspaces.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n### 1. Test Infrastructure Assessment\r\n\r\n**Current State:**\r\n\r\n- **Test Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library (RTL) properly configured\r\n- **Test Organization**: Well-structured `src/__tests__/` directory with unit, integration, and component tests\r\n- **Test Utilities**: [`mockData.ts`](src/__tests__/utils/mockData.ts), [`renderWithProviders.tsx`](src/__tests__/utils/renderWithProviders.tsx), [`testStore.ts`](src/__tests__/utils/testStore.ts) present\r\n- **Coverage Command**: `npm run test:coverage` available\r\n\r\n**Critical Gaps:**\r\n\r\n- **No E2E Testing Framework**: Missing Playwright, Cypress, or similar for cross-workspace integration validation\r\n- **No Visual Regression Testing**: Missing Storybook or Chromatic for UI consistency across workspaces\r\n- **No API Contract Testing**: Missing tools like Pact for frontend-backend contract validation\r\n- **No Test Data Seeding Strategy**: Multi-workspace architecture requires synchronized test data across workspaces\r\n\r\n### 2. Multi-Workspace Testing Risks\r\n\r\n**Risk 1: Integration Test Fragmentation**\r\n\r\n- **Issue**: 5 separate workspaces (frontend, backend, testing, assets, devops) will have isolated test suites\r\n- **Impact**: Cross-workspace integration bugs may slip through until production\r\n- **Recommendation**: Implement a \"smoke test suite\" that runs at the orchestration level, validating:\r\n  - Frontend can communicate with Backend API\r\n  - Assets are properly loaded from assets-workspace\r\n  - DevOps deployment scripts work end-to-end\r\n  - Testing-workspace can execute tests across all workspaces\r\n\r\n**Risk 2: Parallel Agent Test Conflicts**\r\n\r\n- **Issue**: 15+ parallel tracks could simultaneously modify shared test fixtures or mock data\r\n- **Impact**: Flaky tests, false positives/negatives\r\n- **Recommendation**: Implement `TEST_LOCK_MANAGER` protocol:\r\n  - Each agent acquires lock on test fixtures before execution\r\n  - Isolated test database schemas for each workspace\r\n  - Test data versioning with checksums\r\n\r\n**Risk 3: Week 1 Test Readiness**\r\n\r\n- **Track 1A (Component Migration)**: No specification for regression tests during migration\r\n- **Track 2A (Express API)**: No API contract tests mentioned\r\n- **Track 2B (Database)**: No database migration testing strategy\r\n- **Track 4A (Art Integration)**: No asset integrity tests (file format validation, size limits)\r\n\r\n### 3. Test Coverage Analysis\r\n\r\n**Existing Test Files:**\r\n\r\n- ƒo. [`PalCard.test.tsx`](src/__tests__/components/PalCard.test.tsx) - Component test\r\n- ƒo. [`feedingSystem.test.tsx`](src/__tests__/integration/feedingSystem.test.tsx) - Integration test\r\n- ƒo. [`palAdoption.test.tsx`](src/__tests__/integration/palAdoption.test.tsx) - Integration test\r\n- ƒo. [`palEngine.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/services/palEngine.test.ts) - Unit test\r\n- ƒo. [`persistence.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/services/persistence.test.ts) - Unit test\r\n- ƒo. Redux slice tests: [`inventorySlice.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/slices/inventorySlice.test.ts), [`palsSlice.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/slices/palsSlice.test.ts), [`playerSlice.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/slices/playerSlice.test.ts), [`villageSlice.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/slices/villageSlice.test.ts)\r\n\r\n**Coverage Gaps:**\r\n\r\n- **No E2E tests** for critical user flows (adoption, feeding, breeding)\r\n- **No performance tests** for large Pal collections (100+ entities)\r\n- **No accessibility tests** (a11y) for WCAG compliance\r\n- **No error boundary tests** for React error handling\r\n- **No PWA tests** for offline functionality validation\r\n- **No 3D rendering tests** for Three.js components\r\n\r\n### 4. Quality Gates Recommendations\r\n\r\n**Pre-Merge Gates (Must-Have):**\r\n\r\n1. **Unit Test Coverage ƒ% 80%** for all new code\r\n2. **TypeScript Strict Mode** (no `any` types)\r\n3. **ESLint Zero Warnings** (auto-fixable warnings block merge)\r\n4. **Integration Tests Pass** for affected modules\r\n\r\n**Pre-Deployment Gates (Must-Have):**\r\n\r\n1. **E2E Smoke Suite** passes on staging environment\r\n2. **Visual Regression Tests** pass for UI changes\r\n3. **Performance Budget** maintained (Lighthouse score ƒ% 90)\r\n4. **Security Scan** passes (npm audit, dependency check)\r\n\r\n**Weekly Release Gates:**\r\n\r\n1. **Full Test Suite** passes across all workspaces\r\n2. **Cross-Workspace Integration Tests** validate end-to-end flows\r\n3. **Load Testing** validates target concurrent users\r\n4. **Accessibility Audit** maintains WCAG AA compliance\r\n\r\n### 5. Week 1 QA Action Items\r\n\r\n**Track 1A (Component Migration):**\r\n\r\n- Add regression tests for each migrated component\r\n- Implement visual snapshots for UI consistency\r\n- Document test coverage requirements\r\n\r\n**Track 2A (Express API):**\r\n\r\n- Create API contract tests using OpenAPI spec\r\n- Implement request/response validation tests\r\n- Add rate limiting and error handling tests\r\n\r\n**Track 2B (Database):**\r\n\r\n- Create migration rollback tests\r\n- Implement data integrity validation tests\r\n- Add database performance benchmarks\r\n\r\n**Track 4A (Art Integration):**\r\n\r\n- Create asset validation tests (format, size, dimensions)\r\n- Implement asset loading performance tests\r\n- Add sprite animation frame tests\r\n\r\n### 6. CI/CD Testing Pipeline Requirements\r\n\r\n**Missing from Plan:**\r\n\r\n- **Automated Test Reporting**: No mention of test result aggregation across workspaces\r\n- **Flaky Test Detection**: No mechanism to identify and quarantine flaky tests\r\n- **Test Parallelization Strategy**: No plan for running tests in parallel across agents\r\n- **Test Data Management**: No strategy for test data versioning and cleanup\r\n\r\n**Recommended Pipeline:**\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nStage 1: Lint & Type Check (all workspaces in parallel)\r\nStage 2: Unit Tests (per workspace, parallel)\r\nStage 3: Integration Tests (cross-workspace)\r\nStage 4: E2E Tests (orchestration level)\r\nStage 5: Performance Tests (staging environment)\r\nStage 6: Security & Compliance Scans\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 7. Test Environment Strategy\r\n\r\n**Current State:**\r\n\r\n- Single development environment\r\n- No staging environment mentioned\r\n- No test data isolation strategy\r\n\r\n**Required Environments:**\r\n\r\n1. **Local**: Each developer runs full test suite\r\n2. **CI**: Automated testing on every PR\r\n3. **Staging**: Pre-production validation with real data\r\n4. **Production**: Smoke tests and monitoring\r\n\r\n**Test Data Strategy:**\r\n\r\n- Seed data scripts for each workspace\r\n- Test data versioning (fixtures/v1, fixtures/v2)\r\n- Data cleanup between test runs\r\n- GDPR-compliant test data (no real user data)\r\n\r\n### 8. \"Needle in a Haystack\" Findings\r\n\r\n**Observation 1: MSW (Mock Service Worker) Present**\r\n\r\n- **File**: [`package.json`](package.json:92) contains `msw: ^2.12.4`\r\n- **Positive**: Enables API mocking for frontend tests\r\n- **Risk**: If not properly configured, mocks may diverge from actual API contracts\r\n- **Action**: Implement contract tests to validate mocks match backend specs\r\n\r\n**Observation 2: Redux Slice Tests Exist**\r\n\r\n- **Files**: [`inventorySlice.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/slices/inventorySlice.test.ts), [`palsSlice.test.ts`](src/__tests__/unit/slices/palsSlice.test.ts), etc.\r\n- **Positive**: Good state management test coverage\r\n- **Gap**: No integration tests for Redux middleware or async thunks\r\n- **Action**: Add tests for async actions and side effects\r\n\r\n**Observation 3: No Test Configuration Files Visible**\r\n\r\n- **Missing**: `.nycrc` for coverage configuration, `playwright.config.ts` for E2E\r\n- **Impact**: Test quality and coverage may be inconsistent\r\n- **Action**: Create test configuration standards document\r\n\r\n### 9. QA Metrics and KPIs\r\n\r\n**Recommended Metrics to Track:**\r\n\r\n- **Test Coverage**: Line, branch, function, statement coverage\r\n- **Test Execution Time**: Total suite runtime (target < 5 minutes)\r\n- **Flaky Test Rate**: Percentage of tests that fail intermittently (target < 2%)\r\n- **Defect Escape Rate**: Bugs found in production vs. pre-production (target < 5%)\r\n- **Mean Time to Fix (MTTF)**: Average time to fix test failures\r\n- **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests passing on main branch (target 100%)\r\n\r\n### 10. Critical QA Blockers for Week 1 Launch\r\n\r\n**BLOCKER 1: No E2E Testing Framework**\r\n\r\n- **Impact**: Cannot validate cross-workspace integration\r\n- **Resolution**: Set up Playwright or Cypress before Week 1 launch\r\n- **Priority**: CRITICAL\r\n\r\n**BLOCKER 2: No Test Data Management Strategy**\r\n\r\n- **Impact**: Tests may fail due to data conflicts\r\n- **Resolution**: Define test data seeding and cleanup procedures\r\n- **Priority**: CRITICAL\r\n\r\n**BLOCKER 3: No Quality Gates Documented**\r\n\r\n- **Impact**: Unclear acceptance criteria for agent deliverables\r\n- **Resolution**: Document quality gates for each track\r\n- **Priority**: HIGH\r\n\r\n**BLOCKER 4: No CI/CD Test Pipeline Design**\r\n\r\n- **Impact**: Cannot automate testing across workspaces\r\n- **Resolution**: Design multi-stage test pipeline\r\n- **Priority**: HIGH\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE\r\n\r\n"}}
