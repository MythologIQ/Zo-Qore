Each agent has a distinct role and is configured with a specific skill prompt from the `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n## Core Development Team\n\n### 1. Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Failure to do so wastes tokens and creates technical debt.**\r\n\r\n### Phase 1: Existence Check (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nBefore implementing ANY feature, verify it doesn't already exist:\r\n\r\n1. **Search for existing implementations**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Check for command handlers\r\n   grep -r \"command_name\" src-tauri/src/\r\n\r\n   # Check for modules\r\n   ls -la src-tauri/src/ | grep feature_name\r\n\r\n   # Check for TypeScript bridges\r\n   grep -r \"feature_name\" src/bridges/\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Check for module directories**\r\n   - Look for `src-tauri/src/feature/` directory structure\r\n   - Directory with `mod.rs` often means comprehensive implementation\r\n   - Standalone `.rs` file might be legacy/stub/wrapper\r\n\r\n3. **Read completion documentation**\r\n   - Check for `docs/03_modules/*/COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` files\r\n   - Look for \"Гo. Phase 1 Complete\" or similar status markers\r\n   - Read `CLAUDE.md` for architecture notes\r\n\r\n4. **Verify what `mod feature;` points to**\r\n   - In Rust: `mod feature;` can point to `feature.rs` OR `feature/mod.rs`\r\n   - Directory takes precedence over file if both exist\r\n   - Check `main.rs` to see what's actually imported\r\n\r\n5. **Check git history for disconnections**\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Look for recent \"backup\" commits\r\n   git log --oneline --since=\"1 week ago\" | grep -i backup\r\n\r\n   # Check when feature file was last modified\r\n   git log --oneline -- src-tauri/src/feature.rs\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Phase 2: Problem Diagnosis (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nIf feature \"doesn't work,\" diagnose WHY before implementing:\r\n\r\n**Possible Causes** (check in order):\r\n1. **Wiring Issue** - Implementation exists but not connected to main.rs\r\n2. **Command Naming Mismatch** - TypeScript calls different name than Rust provides\r\n3. **State Not Initialized** - Manager exists but not in Tauri state\r\n4. **Missing Registration** - Command exists but not in invoke_handler\r\n5. **Type Mismatch** - Request struct doesn't match TypeScript expectations\r\n6. **Actual Missing Implementation** - Legitimately doesn't exist (verify first!)\r\n\r\n**Diagnostic Questions to Ask User:**\r\n- \"I found existing implementation in `src-tauri/src/feature/`. Should I connect it or replace it?\"\r\n- \"There's a comprehensive module with X lines of code. Why might it not be in use?\"\r\n- \"Git history shows this was disconnected recently. What happened?\"\r\n\r\n### Phase 3: Estimation Validation (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nBefore estimating implementation work:\r\n\r\n1. **Verify implementation isn't duplicating existing work**\r\n   - Check line counts: `wc -l src-tauri/src/feature/*.rs`\r\n   - Review existing command handlers with `grep \"#\\[tauri::command\\]\"`\r\n   - Look for test files that might document what exists\r\n\r\n2. **Consider \"wiring\" vs \"building\"**\r\n   - **Wiring** (2-4 hours): Connect existing implementation to main.rs\r\n   - **Building** (20-40 hours): Implement from scratch\r\n   - Don't estimate building when wiring is sufficient!\r\n\r\n3. **Check for backup/legacy files**\r\n   - Files named `*_legacy.rs`, `*_old.rs`, `*.bak` indicate refactoring\r\n   - Don't rebuild what exists in a backup - investigate instead\r\n\r\n### Phase 4: Architecture Verification (MANDATORY)\r\n\r\nBefore implementing, understand current architecture:\r\n\r\n1. **Module Pattern Check**\r\n   ```rust\r\n   // Single file pattern (simple/legacy)\r\n   mod feature;  // Points to feature.rs\r\n\r\n   // Module directory pattern (comprehensive)\r\n   mod feature;  // Points to feature/mod.rs\r\n   use feature::manager::*;\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **State Management Check**\r\n   - Search for `State<'_, FeatureState>` in existing code\r\n   - Check if managers are initialized in setup hook\r\n   - Verify database connections are passed to managers\r\n\r\n3. **Command Naming Convention Check**\r\n   - Real module might use: `feature_entity_action`\r\n   - TypeScript bridge might call: `feature_action`\r\n   - Need compatibility aliases if mismatch\r\n\r\n### Checklist Summary (Use This Every Time)\r\n\r\n**Before ANY implementation:**\r\n- [ ] Searched codebase for existing implementations\r\n- [ ] Checked for module directories matching feature\r\n- [ ] Read completion/status documentation\r\n- [ ] Verified what `mod feature;` actually imports\r\n- [ ] Checked git history for recent changes/backups\r\n- [ ] Diagnosed WHY feature doesn't work (not just assumed missing)\r\n- [ ] Asked user for clarification if comprehensive implementation exists unused\r\n- [ ] Estimated correctly (wiring vs building from scratch)\r\n- [ ] Understood current architecture pattern\r\n- [ ] Checked for command naming conventions\r\n\r\n**Red Flags (STOP and investigate):**\r\n- Гs Л,? Directory `src-tauri/src/feature/` exists with many files\r\n- Гs Л,? Documentation says \"Гo. Phase 1 Complete\" but user says doesn't work\r\n- Гs Л,? Found file named `*_legacy.rs` or `*_old.rs`\r\n- Гs Л,? Git log shows recent \"backup\" commit\r\n- Гs Л,? Line counts are substantial (>500 lines indicates mature implementation)\r\n- Гs Л,? Manager structs exist (`FeatureManager`, `TaskManager`, etc.)\r\n- Гs Л,? Database schemas exist (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS feature_*`)\r\n\r\n### Example: Correct Verification Flow\r\n\r\n**User says:** \"Calendar doesn't work\"\r\n\r\n**Wrong approach:** \"I'll implement calendar commands\" Г+' Start coding\r\n\r\n**Correct approach:**\r\n1. Search: `grep -r \"calendar\" src-tauri/src/` Г+' Found `alden/calendar.rs`!\r\n2. Check size: `wc -l src-tauri/src/alden/calendar.rs` Г+' 428 lines!\r\n3. Look for commands: `grep \"#\\[tauri::command\\]\" calendar.rs` Г+' Found 6 commands!\r\n4. Check main.rs: No import of `alden::calendar::*` Г+' **This is a wiring issue!**\r\n5. Ask user: \"Found comprehensive calendar implementation. Should I connect it?\"\r\n\r\n**Result:** Wiring fix (2 hours) instead of rebuild (20 hours) Г+' **90% token savings!**\r\n\r\n### Accountability\r\n\r\nThis protocol was established after discovering ~400 lines of redundant calendar implementation were created when a comprehensive 428-line implementation already existed but wasn't connected. The waste: 88K tokens (44% of session budget).\r\n\r\n**This must never happen again.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou are the project planner and technical leader for Hearthlink, ensuring clear requirements, solid technical specifications, effective project management, and successful delivery of an accessible, high-quality AI assistant application. **You must complete the Pre-Implementation Verification Protocol before any feature work.**\r\n"}}

Desktop-First Architecture\r\n**Decision**: Tauri-based desktop application, not web-first\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- Deep OS integration required (file system, system tray, notifications)\r\n- Better performance and resource control\r\n- Offline-first capabilities\r\n- Enhanced security through native capabilities\r\n- Direct hardware access (GPU for LLM inference)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Multi-Agent Modular Design\r\n**Decision**: Separate modules for each agent (Alden, Vault, etc.)\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- Clear separation of concerns\r\n- Independent development and testing\r\n- Easier to add new agents\r\n- Simplified maintenance\r\n- Better code organization\r\n\r\n**Implementation**:\r\n```\r\nsrc-tauri/src/\r\nƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? main.rs              # Entry point, coordination\r\nƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? alden/\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? mod.rs          # Module definition\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? commands.rs     # IPC commands\r\nƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? vault/\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? mod.rs\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? commands.rs\r\nƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? shared/             # Shared utilities\r\n    ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? database.rs\r\n    ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? llm.rs\r\n    ƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? state.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Bridge Pattern for IPC\r\n**Decision**: TypeScript bridge classes for each agent\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- Type-safe frontend-backend communication\r\n- Centralized error handling\r\n- Consistent API across all agents\r\n- Easier to mock for testing\r\n- Clear contracts between layers\r\n\r\n#### 4. SQLite for Local Storage\r\n**Decision**: Embedded SQLite database\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- No server setup required\r\n- ACID compliance\r\n- Excellent performance for single-user app\r\n- Full SQL capabilities\r\n- Simple backup (single file)\r\n\r\n### Security Architecture\r\n\r\n#### Threat Model\r\n\r\n**Assets to Protect**:\r\n- User personal data (tasks, calendar, emails)\r\n- Agent conversation history\r\n- Authentication credentials\r\n- Stored knowledge base\r\n- User preferences and settings\r\n\r\n**Threats**:\r\n1. **Unauthorized Access**: Local file system access, process inspection\r\n2. **Data Exfiltration**: Network snooping, clipboard monitoring\r\n3. **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, XSS (in webview)\r\n4. **Privilege Escalation**: IPC command exploitation\r\n5. **Data Loss**: File corruption, deletion, ransomware\r\n\r\n**Mitigations**:\r\n```rust\r\n// 1. Input Validation\r\nfn validate_user_id(user_id: &str) -> Result<(), SecurityError> {\r\n    if user_id.is_empty() || user_id.len() > 255 {\r\n        return Err(SecurityError::InvalidInput);\r\n    }\r\n    if !user_id.chars().all(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || c == '-' || c == '_') {\r\n        return Err(SecurityError::InvalidCharacters);\r\n    }\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 2. SQL Injection Prevention\r\nfn get_user_tasks(conn: &Connection, user_id: &str) -> Result<Vec<Task>> {\r\n    // Use parameterized queries\r\n    let mut stmt = conn.prepare(\"SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE user_id = ?1\")?;\r\n    let tasks = stmt.query_map(params![user_id], |row| {\r\n        // ...\r\n    })?;\r\n    Ok(tasks.collect()?)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 3. Path Traversal Prevention\r\nfn safe_file_access(base_dir: &Path, user_path: &str) -> Result<PathBuf> {\r\n    let full_path = base_dir.join(user_path);\r\n    let canonical = full_path.canonicalize()\r\n        .map_err(|_| SecurityError::InvalidPath)?;\r\n\r\n    if !canonical.starts_with(base_dir) {\r\n        return Err(SecurityError::PathTraversal);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Ok(canonical)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 4. Tauri Allowlist Configuration\r\n// tauri.conf.json\r\n{\r\n  \"tauri\": {\r\n    \"allowlist\": {\r\n      \"all\": false,\r\n      \"fs\": {\r\n        \"scope\": [\"$APPDATA/*\",

Key, Nonce};\r\nuse aes_gcm::aead::{Aead, NewAead};\r\n\r\n// Encrypt sensitive data at rest\r\nfn encrypt_sensitive_data(data: &[u8], key: &[u8; 32]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, CryptoError> {\r\n    let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(Key::from_slice(key));\r\n    let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(&generate_nonce());\r\n\r\n    let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(nonce, data)\r\n        .map_err(|_| CryptoError::EncryptionFailed)?;\r\n\r\n    Ok(ciphertext)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Store encryption key securely (OS keychain integration)\r\n#[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\r\nfn store_encryption_key(key: &[u8; 32]) -> Result<()> {\r\n    // Use Windows DPAPI\r\n    use windows::Win32::Security::Cryptography::*;\r\n    // Implementation...\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[cfg(target_os = \"macos\")]\r\nfn store_encryption_key(key: &[u8; 32]) -> Result<()> {\r\n    // Use macOS Keychain\r\n    use security_framework::keychain::*;\r\n    // Implementation...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Performance Architecture\r\n\r\n#### Caching Strategy\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse lru::LruCache;\r\nuse std::sync::Arc;\r\nuse tokio::sync::RwLock;\r\n\r\nstruct CacheLayer {\r\n    // L1: In-memory LRU cache for hot

Original path preserved under /legacy_import/ -->\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nTo define a universal, explicit, and evolvable schema and operational contract for agent-to-agent, agent-to-system, and cross-module context exchanges within Hearthlink. The MCP is the canonical protocol by which all memory, intent, feedback, and meta-context flows are described, validated, and versionedƒ?\"enabling secure, auditable, and future-proof interoperability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. Protocol Philosophy\r\n\r\n- **Explicit Boundaries:** All context and data passed between agents, plugins, and modules is strictly schema-bound and versioned.\r\n- **Composable & Minimal:** Start with MCP-Lite (intent, context anchor, memory reference, feedback). Extensions are opt-in and versioned.\r\n- **Auditability:** Every MCP transaction is logged by Sentry with request, response, and agent/user metadata.\r\n- **No Direct Local Memory Mediation:** Local persona memory is never routed through Core unless user initiates a communal memory operation.\r\n- **Zero Trust, User-First:** Every cross-agent or external context exchange is authenticated, logged, and user-reviewable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Protocol Scope\r\n\r\n- **In-Scope:**\r\n  - All agent-to-agent or agent-to-system context and memory references\r\n  - Session/context anchoring for Core Communal Memory\r\n  - Plugin or external agent interactions via Synapse\r\n  - Memory slice migration or protocol negotiation\r\n- **Out-of-Scope:**\r\n  - Direct agent-to-Vault local memory operations (these use native Vault APIs, not MCP)\r\n  - UI/UX-only flows with no system memory/intent transfer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Protocol Schema\r\n\r\n**All MCP payloads are JSON or YAML (with JSON as default wire format).**\r\n\r\n### 3.1 MCP-Lite: Minimal Transaction\r\n\r\n```\r\njson\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopyEdit\r\n\r\n`{ \"mcp_version\": \"1.0.0\", \"msg_id\": \"uuid-12345\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-06T22:30:00Z\", \"from_agent\": \"alden\", \"to_agent\": \"alice\", \"context_anchor\": \"session-0099\", \"intent\": { \"type\": \"reflection_request\", \"description\": \"Review recent goal milestone\" }, \"memory_refs\": [ { \"vault_id\": \"alden-slice-001\", \"slice_type\": \"habit-streak\", \"access_scope\": \"read-only\" } ], \"feedback\": { \"confirmation\": true, \"status_flag\": \"pending\" }, \"extensions\": null }`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Full Field Definitions\r\n\r\n| FieldTypeRequiredDescription |        |          |                                                                   |\r\n| ---------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| mcp\\_version                 | string | yes      | Protocol version, e.g. \"1.0.0\"                                    |\r\n| msg\\_id                      | string | yes      | Unique transaction/request ID (UUID)                              |\r\n| timestamp                    | string | yes      | ISO8601 UTC timestamp                                             |\r\n| from\\_agent                  | string | yes      | Originating persona/module name                                   |\r\n| to\\_agent                    | string | yes      | Destination persona/module name                                   |\r\n| context\\_anchor              | string | yes      | Session, event, or object this context references                 |\r\n| intent                       | object | yes      | { type, description, [params] }                                   |\r\n| memory\\_refs                 | array  | optional | References to Vault memory slices/objects by ID/type/scope        |\r\n| feedback                     | object | optional | Status/confirmation, rejection, error, or meta-response           |\r\n| extensions                   | object | optional | Arbitrary extension fields for new features, versioned sub-schema |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Operation & Flow\r\n\r\n### 4.1 Request Lifecycle\r\n\r\n1. **Initiation:**\\\r\n   Agent/module creates a signed MCP payload (JSON).\r\n2. **Transmission:**\\\r\n   Payload delivered via Core (for communal/session context) or Synapse (for plugins/external).\r\n3. **Validation:**\\\r\n   Receiving agent/system checks version, schema, intent, and permissions.\\\r\n   Rejects or requests fallback on error/mismatch.\r\n4. **Execution:**\\\r\n   Action, review, or reflection performed using referenced context/memory only if permissioned.\r\n5. **Feedback:**\\\r\n   Response MCP sent with feedback object and any outputs/next-action hints.\r\n6. **Logging:**\\\r\n   Every MCP transaction is Sentry-logged (with redaction for sensitive fields as needed).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4.2 Security & Error Handling\r\n\r\n- All cross-agent/system MCP exchanges require mutual authentication (agent keys, session tokens).\r\n- Invalid, unauthorized, or ambiguous MCPs are rejected, logged, and surfaced to user/admin for review.\r\n- Extension fields must be ignored by incompatible agents/modules; fallback to last supported schema.\r\n- MCP traffic is always encrypted in transit (local or remote).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4.3 Versioning & Negotiation\r\n\r\n- Every MCP includes a version header.\r\n- If version mismatch, protocol negotiation sequence is triggered:\r\n  - Fallback to last mutually supported version.\r\n  - If not possible, reject with feedback (error, reason, expected version).\r\n- All extensions are opt-in, namespaced, and versioned (e.g., `\"extensions\": { \"rationale-v2\": { ... } }`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Protocol Extensions (Examples)\r\n\r\n- **Agent Analytics:**\\\r\n  `\"extensions\": { \"persona_analytics\": { \"openness\": 74, \"agreeableness\": 82 } }`\r\n- **Session Rules:**\\\r\n  `\"extensions\": { \"session_rules\": { \"max_agents\": 8, \"turn_policy\": \"moderator\" } }`\r\n- **Plugin/External API:**\\\r\n  `\"extensions\": { \"external_call\": { \"plugin_id\": \"summarizer-v2\", \"result_ref\": \"plugin-log-77\" } }`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6. Reference Implementation and Testing\r\n\r\n- MCP validator provided as CLI tool and Node/Python module.\r\n- All agents/modules must include test harness for all supported MCP versions and fallbacks.\r\n- Protocol evolution follows strict versioning (semver); breaking changes require migration guide.\r\n- Full transaction logs are reviewable in Sentry.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7. Sample Flows\r\n\r\n### 7.1 Cross-Agent Reflection Request (Alden ƒ+' Alice)\r\n\r\n1. Alden sends MCP:\r\n   - Intent: `\"type\": \"reflection_request\"`\r\n   - Memory Ref: `\"alden-slice-001\"`\r\n2. Core validates, forwards to Alice.\r\n3. Alice reviews context, sends feedback (confirmation + insight).\r\n4. All steps logged; user can review in session audit.\r\n\r\n### 7.2 Plugin Operation (Core ƒ+' Synapse ƒ+' External Plugin)\r\n\r\n1. Core assembles MCP, referencing session context and plugin permissions.\r\n2. Synapse checks manifest, permissions, risk score.\r\n3. Plugin invoked; output/feedback attached as `\"extensions\"`.\r\n4. All traffic logged by Sentry, with audit trail.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8. Security, Privacy, and User Control\r\n\r\n- MCP payloads are always auditable and exportable.\r\n- All agents honor ƒ?oredactƒ?? flags; user can mask fields from audit/UI if desired.\r\n- No memory migration, export, or cross-agent context is permitted without user-initiated action and full logging.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9. Protocol Governance\r\n\r\n- MCP spec is version-controlled in public repo with migration docs and deprecation schedule.\r\n- Proposed extensions or changes must be RFCƒ?Td, reviewed, and backward-compatible unless major version bump.\r\n"}}

All fields are versioned and tagged.\\\r\n  Each slice is only accessible by its owner agentƒ?\"except during user-approved migrations or Core-facilitated handshakes.\r\n- **Data Storage:**\\\r\n  AES-256+ encrypted, local-first, never cloud by default.\\\r\n  Supports schema evolution and migrationƒ?\"automatically upgrades or flags for manual intervention.\r\n- **Audit Log:**\\\r\n  All access, edit, export, and purge events are logged, timestamped, and user-visible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Memory Slice API Contracts**\r\n\r\n- `POST /api/vault/persona-memory/{persona_id}`\\\r\n  _Create or update any persona memory slice (enforces field schema and versioning)_\r\n- `PATCH /api/vault/persona-memory/{persona_id}/:id`\\\r\n  _Partial update to a persona slice (traits, fields, or tags)_\r\n- `GET /api/vault/persona-memory/{persona_id}/export`\\\r\n  _Export all data for a persona as JSON/CSV, including logs_\r\n- `POST /api/vault/persona-memory/{persona_id}/import`\\\r\n  _Import data into a persona slice, version- and schema-aware_\r\n- `POST /api/vault/persona-memory/{persona_id}/purge`\\\r\n  _User-initiated wipe of all data for that persona_\r\n- `GET /api/vault/audit`\\\r\n  _Retrieve the global Vault audit log_\r\n\r\n**All endpoints enforce strict RBAC/ABAC controls and trigger audit entries.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **UI/Component Contract (React/Typescript)**\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ntype VaultMemoryProps = {\r\n  personaId: string;\r\n  records: PersonaRecord[];\r\n  exportable: boolean;\r\n  onExport: () => void;\r\n  onPurge: () => void;\r\n  onEdit: (recordId: string, patch: Partial<PersonaRecord>) => void;\r\n  auditLog: AuditEvent[];\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Memory Dashboard:**\\\r\n  Lists content by topic, relevance, frequency.\\\r\n  Filter, search, and manage all slices.\r\n- **Access Management:**\\\r\n  User can see what data each persona has, control what's shared or deleted, review audit logs.\r\n- **Export/Purge:**\\\r\n  All actions prompt confirmation, show effect, and generate audit entries.\r\n- **Accessibility:**\\\r\n  All controls keyboard-accessible, logs are human-readable, exportable in multiple formats.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **RBAC/ABAC Enforcement**\r\n\r\n- **Roles:** user, admin, system\r\n- **Attributes:** persona, operation (read, edit, export, purge)\r\n- **Policy:**\r\n  - Only persona owner (user) can export or purge memory.\r\n  - No cross-persona read/write except through explicit, auditable user-mediated Core or migration event.\r\n  - System may trigger schema migration but not access data.\r\n- **Audit:**\\\r\n  Every operation, export, purge, migration, or handshake is logged.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Migration & Multi-System Handshake**\r\n\r\n- **Migration Utility:**\\\r\n  Tools for dry-run migrations (schema or data version changes), with explicit field mapping and rollback.\r\n- **Handshake Protocol:**\\\r\n  For future multi-system, a new isolated DB per system with strict, user-reviewed schema for any shared memory.\r\n- **Schema Versioning:**\\\r\n  Each memory slice is tagged with `schema_version`; upgrades require user review and audit log entry.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **User Control & Privacy**\r\n\r\n- **Export/Import:**\\\r\n  Any data or memory slice is exportable for review or backup; import is schema-checked.\r\n- **Purge:**\\\r\n  User can purge any persona's memory or Vault as a whole, with confirmation and audit log.\r\n- **Visibility:**\\\r\n  User dashboard shows all data, frequency of use, and relevanceƒ?\"never hidden or inaccessible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This section is now at full implementation-level detail.

System Overview\r\n\r\nHearthlink is a privacy-first, modular, and local-first AI ecosystem for personal knowledge work and agent orchestration. All modules (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry, Vault, Core, Synapse) are strictly containerized and enforce user sovereignty, auditable actions, and explicit separation of local and shared/communal memory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Architectural Requirements\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Modularity & Boundaries\r\n\r\n- Each module (Alden, Alice, Mimic, Sentry, Core, Vault, Synapse) runs as a discrete service or process, communicating via IPC/WebSocket API.\r\n- **Core never mediates or accesses local persona memory or local Vault databases.**\r\n- **Local agent memory is always direct agent-to-Vault. Core is only used for memory operations when explicitly working with Core Communal Memory.**\r\n- All cross-agent, collaborative, plugin, or external flows (session logs, roundtables, plugin ops, etc.) are mediated by Core, logged by Sentry, and stored in Vaultƒ?Ts shared/communal area when user-approved.\r\n- Sentry hooks every event, and Synapse governs all external/plugin flows.\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Data Security\r\n\r\n- AES-256 (or higher) encryption at rest.\r\n- Each agent/persona maintains an isolated, encrypted memory schema.\r\n- No cloud, SaaS, or background telemetry by default.\r\n- User is always able to view, export, and delete all data.\r\n- OS keyring, hardware TPM, or secure enclave for key management.\r\n\r\n### 2.3 Process, Resource, and Plugin Management\r\n\r\n- All agent, plugin, and extension processes sandboxed; least privilege.\r\n- Logging/caching is tunable per module; capped by user/system preference.\r\n- Plugins/extensions are only installed and executed through Synapse, with permission manifest, sandbox, risk/benchmark scores, and Sentry monitoring.\r\n\r\n### 2.4 UI/UX & Accessibility\r\n\r\n- All UIs are built with Next.js/React, modular, and fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).\r\n- All user-facing flows match MythologIQƒ?Ts mythic-tech theme.\r\n- Persona dashboards, utility strips, status bars, and logs are fully keyboard and screen reader accessible.\r\n- All persona UIs reflect their core purpose and data contract.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Module Technical Requirements\r\n"}}

Original path preserved under /legacy_import/ -->\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nTo define a universal, explicit, and evolvable schema and operational contract for agent-to-agent, agent-to-system, and cross-module context exchanges within Hearthlink. The MCP is the canonical protocol by which all memory, intent, feedback, and meta-context flows are described, validated, and versionedƒ?\"enabling secure, auditable, and future-proof interoperability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. Protocol Philosophy\r\n\r\n- **Explicit Boundaries:** All context and data passed between agents, plugins, and modules is strictly schema-bound and versioned.\r\n- **Composable & Minimal:** Start with MCP-Lite (intent, context anchor, memory reference, feedback). Extensions are opt-in and versioned.\r\n- **Auditability:** Every MCP transaction is logged by Sentry with request, response, and agent/user metadata.\r\n- **No Direct Local Memory Mediation:** Local persona memory is never routed through Core unless user initiates a communal memory operation.\r\n- **Zero Trust, User-First:** Every cross-agent or external context exchange is authenticated, logged, and user-reviewable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Protocol Scope\r\n\r\n- **In-Scope:**\r\n  - All agent-to-agent or agent-to-system context and memory references\r\n  - Session/context anchoring for Core Communal Memory\r\n  - Plugin or external agent interactions via Synapse\r\n  - Memory slice migration or protocol negotiation\r\n- **Out-of-Scope:**\r\n  - Direct agent-to-Vault local memory operations (these use native Vault APIs, not MCP)\r\n  - UI/UX-only flows with no system memory/intent transfer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Protocol Schema\r\n\r\n**All MCP payloads are JSON or YAML (with JSON as default wire format).**\r\n\r\n### 3.1 MCP-Lite: Minimal Transaction\r\n\r\n```\r\njson\r\n```\r\n\r\n"}}

Core is only used for memory operations when explicitly working with Core Communal Memory.**\r\n13: - All cross-agent, collaborative, plugin, or external flows (session logs, roundtables, plugin ops, etc.) are mediated by Core, logged by Sentry, and stored in Vaultƒ?Ts shared/communal area when user-approved.\r\n14: - Sentry hooks every event, and Synapse governs all external/plugin flows.\r\n15: \r\n16: ### 2.2 Data Security\r\n17: \r\n18: - AES-256 (or higher) encryption at rest.\r\n19: - Each agent/persona maintains an isolated, encrypted memory schema.\r\n20: - No cloud, SaaS, or background telemetry by default.\r\n21: - User is always able to view, export, and delete all data.\r\n22: - OS keyring, hardware TPM, or secure enclave for key management.\r\n23: \r\n24: ### 2.3 Process, Resource, and Plugin Management\r\n25: \r\n26: - All agent, plugin, and extension processes sandboxed; least privilege.\r\n27: - Logging/caching is tunable per module; capped by user/system preference.\r\n28: - Plugins/extensions are only installed and executed through Synapse, with permission manifest, sandbox, risk/benchmark scores, and Sentry monitoring.\r\n29: \r\n30: ### 2.4 UI/UX & Accessibility\r\n31: \r\n32: - All UIs are built with Next.js/React, modular, and fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).\r\n33: - All user-facing flows match MythologIQƒ?Ts mythic-tech theme.\r\n34: - Persona dashboards, utility strips, status bars, and logs are fully keyboard and screen reader accessible.\r\n35: - All persona UIs reflect their core purpose and data contract.\r\n36: \r\n37: ---\r\n38: \r\n39: ## 3. Module Technical Requirements\r\n40: \r\n41: ### 3.1 Alden (Evolutionary Companion)\r\n42: \r\n43: - **UI:** Dashboard/hub, cognition engine, relationship log, and self-reflection overlays.\r\n44: - **Logic:** Growth, streaks, and learning logs to Aldenƒ?Ts Vault slice; no other persona can access this data.\r\n45: - **API:** CRUD for tasks, habits, feedback, and milestone journaling; export/import with full changelog.\r\n46: - **Interaction:** ƒ?oReflect,ƒ?? ƒ?oTeach,ƒ?? and ƒ?oCoachƒ?? events update Aldenƒ?Ts learning model, with all interactions logged.\r\n47: \r\n48: ### 3.2 Alice (Behavioral Analytics)\r\n49: \r\n50: - **UI:** Dashboard for tone/cadence trends, empathy overlays, understanding scroll.\r\n51: - **Logic:** Adapts to userƒ?Ts meta-communication; never accesses task, goal, or direct memory.\r\n52: - **API:** Log, query, feedback injection, correction endpoints.\r\n53: - **Security:** All corrections/audits logged; evolution tracked per user session, always user-reviewable.\r\n54: \r\n55: ### 3.3 Mimic (Persona Generator)\r\n56: \r\n57: - **UI:** Persona carousel, analytics dashboard, creation/curation wizard.\r\n58: - **Logic:** Each persona has its own encrypted memory slice, indexed by user-supplied traits.\r\n59: - **API:** CRUD for persona data, performance analytics, archive/restore, export/import.\r\n60: \r\n61: ### 3.4 Sentry (Guardian/Security)\r\n62: \r\n63: - **Process:** Root/elevated if required, only user/admin can stop Sentry.\r\n64: - **Logic:** Monitors and can kill/block/rollback any agent, process, or plugin.\r\n65: - **UI:** Technical log view and user-friendly compliance dashboard.\r\n66: - **API:** Subscribe/log event, policy update, override, incident review/export.\r\n67: \r\n68: ### 3.5 Vault (Secure Memory Store)\r\n69: \r\n70: - **Backend:** JSON, SQLite, or local DB, segregated per persona.\r\n71: - **Security:** All access by API only, export/purge/backup user-controlled.\r\n72: - **API:** CRUD, query, audit log, user export/import.\r\n73: \r\n74: ### 3.6 Core (Orchestrator/Communal Context)\r\n75: \r\n76: - **Process:** Local WebSocket/IPC process manager for sessions and cross-agent events.\r\n77: - **Logic:** Only manages shared/communal memory and agent-to-agent or external flows.\r\n78: - **API:** Session control, agent suggestion, session log, room management, export.\r\n79: \r\n"}}
