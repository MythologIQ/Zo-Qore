Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

Desktop-First Architecture\r\n**Decision**: Tauri-based desktop application, not web-first\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- Deep OS integration required (file system, system tray, notifications)\r\n- Better performance and resource control\r\n- Offline-first capabilities\r\n- Enhanced security through native capabilities\r\n- Direct hardware access (GPU for LLM inference)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Multi-Agent Modular Design\r\n**Decision**: Separate modules for each agent (Alden, Vault, etc.)\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- Clear separation of concerns\r\n- Independent development and testing\r\n- Easier to add new agents\r\n- Simplified maintenance\r\n- Better code organization\r\n\r\n**Implementation**:\r\n```\r\nsrc-tauri/src/\r\nƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? main.rs              # Entry point, coordination\r\nƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? alden/\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? mod.rs          # Module definition\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? commands.rs     # IPC commands\r\nƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? vault/\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? mod.rs\r\nƒ\",   ƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? commands.rs\r\nƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? shared/             # Shared utilities\r\n    ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? database.rs\r\n    ƒ\"oƒ\"?ƒ\"? llm.rs\r\n    ƒ\"\"ƒ\"?ƒ\"? state.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Bridge Pattern for IPC\r\n**Decision**: TypeScript bridge classes for each agent\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- Type-safe frontend-backend communication\r\n- Centralized error handling\r\n- Consistent API across all agents\r\n- Easier to mock for testing\r\n- Clear contracts between layers\r\n\r\n#### 4. SQLite for Local Storage\r\n**Decision**: Embedded SQLite database\r\n**Rationale**:\r\n- No server setup required\r\n- ACID compliance\r\n- Excellent performance for single-user app\r\n- Full SQL capabilities\r\n- Simple backup (single file)\r\n\r\n### Security Architecture\r\n\r\n#### Threat Model\r\n\r\n**Assets to Protect**:\r\n- User personal data (tasks, calendar, emails)\r\n- Agent conversation history\r\n- Authentication credentials\r\n- Stored knowledge base\r\n- User preferences and settings\r\n\r\n**Threats**:\r\n1. **Unauthorized Access**: Local file system access, process inspection\r\n2. **Data Exfiltration**: Network snooping, clipboard monitoring\r\n3. **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, XSS (in webview)\r\n4. **Privilege Escalation**: IPC command exploitation\r\n5. **Data Loss**: File corruption, deletion, ransomware\r\n\r\n**Mitigations**:\r\n```rust\r\n// 1. Input Validation\r\nfn validate_user_id(user_id: &str) -> Result<(), SecurityError> {\r\n    if user_id.is_empty() || user_id.len() > 255 {\r\n        return Err(SecurityError::InvalidInput);\r\n    }\r\n    if !user_id.chars().all(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || c == '-' || c == '_') {\r\n        return Err(SecurityError::InvalidCharacters);\r\n    }\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 2. SQL Injection Prevention\r\nfn get_user_tasks(conn: &Connection, user_id: &str) -> Result<Vec<Task>> {\r\n    // Use parameterized queries\r\n    let mut stmt = conn.prepare(\"SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE user_id = ?1\")?;\r\n    let tasks = stmt.query_map(params![user_id], |row| {\r\n        // ...\r\n    })?;\r\n    Ok(tasks.collect()?)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 3. Path Traversal Prevention\r\nfn safe_file_access(base_dir: &Path, user_path: &str) -> Result<PathBuf> {\r\n    let full_path = base_dir.join(user_path);\r\n    let canonical = full_path.canonicalize()\r\n        .map_err(|_| SecurityError::InvalidPath)?;\r\n\r\n    if !canonical.starts_with(base_dir) {\r\n        return Err(SecurityError::PathTraversal);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Ok(canonical)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 4.

[ ] Verify SidebarChat 3-state functionality in browser\r\n2. [ ] Update ACTUAL_STATUS.md with current state\r\n3. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to VaultDashboard\r\n4.

Dashboard sets `residentAgentId` based on module (Alden, Alice, Vault, Mimic).\\n2. User toggles state in `SidebarChat`, dashboard updates `chatState`.\\n3. When `expanded`, `UnifiedChatLayout` is mounted via portal.\\n4. `AgentBridge` dispatches messages to `ActiveAgentPanel` and `PrivateChannel` via shared state and IPC bridge.\\n\\n### Security Considerations\\n- Validate agent/persona identifiers on IPC boundaries.\\n- Enforce persona isolation at the data layer (no cross-persona leakage).\\n\\n### Performance Characteristics\\n- `expanded` view mounts only on demand to reduce baseline cost.\\n- Keep chat history virtualization inside `ChatView` to avoid rendering spikes.\\n\\n### Trade-offs\\n- Portal overlay simplifies layout but requires explicit focus management.\\n- Single dashboard-owned state reduces component complexity but centralizes responsibility.\\n\\n### Implementation Notes (KISS)\\n- Keep `SidebarChat` as a minimal 3-state wrapper.\\n- Avoid extra overlays; use portal + explicit z-index for the full-screen layout.\\n- Ensure GlobalCommsStream is disabled or hidden when `expanded` to prevent ghost windows.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Alice Deep Work State Flow\\n\\n### Requirements Summary\\n- Provide a clear, minimal state flow for Alice that supports focused work sessions.\\n- Integrate with Universal Chat as the interaction channel.\\n- Ensure easy entry/exit, pause/resume, and recovery after interruption.\\n\\n### State Machine\\n- `idle` -> `armed` -> `entering` -> `active` -> `exiting` -> `idle`\\n- Optional branches: `paused`, `interrupted`, `recovery`\\n\\n### State Definitions\\n- `idle`: No active deep work context.\\n- `armed`: User intent captured (goal/task selected, timer configured).\\n- `entering`: Alice primes context, confirms constraints, and prepares workspace.\\n- `active`: Focus session running; notifications limited; periodic check-ins.\\n- `paused`: User-initiated pause; timer stops; context preserved.\\n- `interrupted`: External disruption; Alice captures interruption context.\\n- `recovery`: Alice guides user back to task (summary + next action).\\n- `exiting`: Session wrap-up; capture outcomes, update records.\\n\\n### Events and Transitions\\n- `start_deep_work` (user or schedule): `idle` -> `armed`\\n- `confirm_start`: `armed` -> `entering`\\n- `ready_signal`: `entering` -> `active`\\n- `pause`: `active` -> `paused`\\n- `resume`: `paused` -> `active`\\n- `interrupt`: `active` -> `interrupted`\\n- `recover`: `interrupted` -> `recovery` -> `active`\\n- `end_session`: `active` -> `exiting` -> `idle`\\n\\n### Data Flow\\n- `DeepWorkSession` record stored in local DB with:\\n  - `session_id`, `user_id`, `goal`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `status`, `checkpoints`\\n- `AgentBridge` events:\\n  - `deep_work.start`, `deep_work.pause`, `deep_work.resume`, `deep_work.interrupt`, `deep_work.end`\\n- `ActiveAgentPanel` shows Alice status and session metrics during `active`.\\n\\n### Security and Privacy\\n- Session data remains local; no cross-persona sharing.\\n- Explicit user confirmation before entering `active` state.\\n\\n### Performance Considerations\\n- Deep work state updates are event-driven; avoid polling.\\n- Only update UI elements in the Active Agent column during `active`.\\n\\nStatus: COMPLETE\\n'@ | Set-Content .agent/staging/responses/AGENT_1_CODEX_ARCHITECT.md\"}","call_id":"call_NcwQu8eXum016S3HbmVpcBNH"}}
