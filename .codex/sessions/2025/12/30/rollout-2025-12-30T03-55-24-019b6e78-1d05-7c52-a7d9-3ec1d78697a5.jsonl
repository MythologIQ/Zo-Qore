Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau\r\n$ mau deploy\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nCheck out a few resources that may come in handy when working with NestJS:\r\n\r\n- Visit the [NestJS Documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com) to learn more about the framework.\r\n- For questions and support, please visit our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/G7Qnnhy).\r\n- To dive deeper and get more hands-on experience, check out our official video [courses](https://courses.nestjs.com/).\r\n- Deploy your application to AWS with the help of [NestJS Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com) in just a few clicks.\r\n- Visualize your application graph and interact with the NestJS application in real-time using [NestJS Devtools](https://devtools.nestjs.com).\r\n- Need help with your project (part-time to full-time)? Check out our official [enterprise support](https://enterprise.nestjs.com).\r\n- To stay in the loop and get updates, follow us on [X](https://x.com/nestframework) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/nestjs).\r\n- Looking for a job, or have a job to offer? Check out our official [Jobs board](https://jobs.nestjs.com).\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project. It can grow thanks to the sponsors and support by the amazing backers.

Access is trust-gated via `maxTrust >= 50` and enforced both globally (`LockedFeatureCard`) and per-adventure requirements in `canStartAdventure` (min pals, sparkles, village joy, required species). Progression uses `startAdventure`, `handleChoice`, and `completeAdventure` with Framer Motion transitions, `AnimatedParticles`, and `FloatingElements`, and awards sparkles through `earnSparkles`. Stage handling currently supports `choice` UI; `action`, `puzzle`, `battle`, and `exploration` types are declared but not yet rendered.\\n\\n**Backend Services**: The backend is a NestJS app in `src/backend/src` with modular services registered in `src/backend/src/app.module.ts` (auth, pals, breeding, inventory, village, homes, player, offline, region, shop, quests, prisma) and a global throttling guard. `src/backend/src/main.ts` sets a global API prefix, enables CORS from env origins, validates env via Zod, and applies a global Zod validation pipe. Auth endpoints and JWT-protected routes are documented in `src/backend/README.md`.\\n\\n**Asset Pipeline**: Assets live in `src/frontend/assets` with an explicit manifest in `src/frontend/assets/assetManifest.ts` mapping IDs to optimized WebP paths and `status` flags (`real`/`mock`). Conversion is automated by `convert_assets.py` (PNG -> WebP, optional name cleanup) and placeholder generation by `generate_missing_mocks.py`. Visual specs and prompts are centralized in `ASSET_REQUIREMENTS.md` to standardize art direction, sizes, and naming.\\n\\n## Status\\nCOMPLETE\\n'@ | Out-File -FilePath .agent/staging/responses/AGENT_1_FRONTEND_SPECIALIST.md -Encoding ascii\",\"workdir\":\"d:\\\\Game builds\\\\Pixel Pal\"}","call_id":"call_9MYn2RzS0JeYgqofstCjLHhW"}}
