Each agent has a distinct role and is configured with a specific skill prompt from the `.claude/skills/` directory.\n\n## Core Development Team\n\n### 1. Specifications Planner\n- **Role:** Gathers requirements, defines project scope, and produces detailed technical specifications (PRDs).\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/project-planner.md](./.claude/skills/project-planner.md)\n\n### 2. System Architect\n- **Role:** Designs the overall system architecture, including security, performance, and database structure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/system-architect.md](./.claude/skills/system-architect.md)\n\n### 3. Agent Architect\n- **Role:** Specializes in the design of the multi-agent ecosystem, communication, and coordination.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/agent-architect.md](./.claude/skills/agent-architect.md)\n\n### 4. Frontend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the UI/UX in React/TypeScript, focusing on accessibility and performance.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-frontend-dev.md)\n\n### 5. Backend Developer\n- **Role:** Implements the core services and IPC architecture in Rust/Tauri.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-backend-dev.md)\n\n## Specialist & Support Roles\n\n### 6. UI/UX Design Specialist\n- **Role:** Focuses on visual design, motion, and creating polished, intuitive interfaces.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md](./.claude/skills/hearthlink-ui-ux-designer.md)\n\n### 7. DevOps Engineer\n- **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and infrastructure.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md](./.claude/skills/devops-engineer.md)\n\n### 8. Accessibility Specialist\n- **Role:** Audits for WCAG compliance and ensures the application is inclusive.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/accessibility-specialist.md)\n\n### 9. Voice Integration Specialist\n- **Role:** Designs and implements voice interfaces, speech recognition, and TTS.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md](./.claude/skills/voice-integration-specialist.md)\n\n### 10. Quality Validator (Code Reviewer)\n- **Role:** Ensures code quality, test coverage, and requirement fulfillment through comprehensive code review and testing validation.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md](./.claude/skills/code-reviewer.md)\n\n### 11. Documentation Scribe\n- **Role:** Creates and maintains comprehensive documentation including API references, user guides, architecture docs, and code comments.\n- **Skill File:** [.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md](./.claude/skills/documentation-scribe.md)\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/krkna/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"vscode","model_provider":"openai"}}

[main.rs:42-51](src-tauri/src/main.rs#L42-L51)\r\n\r\n## Specialized Knowledge\r\n\r\n### Tauri IPC Best Practices\r\n\r\n#### Command Design\r\n```rust\r\n// Good: Structured parameters, clear response types\r\n#[derive(Debug, serde::Deserialize)]\r\nstruct CreateTaskParams {\r\n    user_id: String,\r\n    title: String,\r\n    description: Option<String>,\r\n    due_date: Option<String>,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, serde::Serialize)]\r\nstruct TaskResponse {\r\n    task_id: String,\r\n    created_at: String,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn create_task(\r\n    state: State<'_, AppState>,\r\n    params: CreateTaskParams,\r\n) -> Result<TaskResponse, String> {\r\n    // Validate inputs\r\n    if params.title.trim().is_empty() {\r\n        return Err(\"Task title cannot be empty\".to_string());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Business logic\r\n    let task = state.db.create_task(params).await\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to create task: {}\", e))?;\r\n\r\n    Ok(TaskResponse {\r\n        task_id: task.id,\r\n        created_at: task.created_at,\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### State Management\r\n```rust\r\nstruct AppState {\r\n    db: Arc<Database>,\r\n    config: Arc<RwLock<Config>>,\r\n    agent_contexts: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, AgentContext>>>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl AppState {\r\n    fn new() -> Self {\r\n        Self {\r\n            db: Arc::new(Database::new()),\r\n            config: Arc::new(RwLock::new(Config::default())),\r\n            agent_contexts: Arc::new(RwLock::new(HashMap::new())),\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Event Emission\r\n```rust\r\nuse tauri::Manager;\r\n\r\n#[tauri::command]\r\nasync fn trigger_event(window: tauri::Window) -> Result<(), String> {\r\n    window.emit(\"event-name\", EventPayload { /* data */ })\r\n        .map_err(|e| format!(\"Failed to emit event: {}\", e))?;\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Database Integration (SQLite)\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse rusqlite::{Connection, params};\r\n\r\nstruct Database {\r\n    conn: Arc<Mutex<Connection>>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Database {\r\n    fn new(path: &Path) -> Result<Self, rusqlite::Error> {\r\n        let conn = Connection::open(path)?;\r\n        Ok(Self {\r\n            conn: Arc::new(Mutex::new(conn)),\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    async fn query_tasks(&self, user_id: &str) -> Result<Vec<Task>, rusqlite::Error> {\r\n        let conn = self.conn.lock().await;\r\n        let mut stmt = conn.prepare(\"SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE user_id = ?1\")?;\r\n        let tasks = stmt.query_map(params![user_id], |row| {\r\n            Ok(Task {\r\n                id: row.get(0)?,\r\n                user_id: row.get(1)?,\r\n                title: row.get(2)?,\r\n                // ... other fields\r\n            })\r\n        })?\r\n        .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;\r\n        Ok(tasks)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Async Patterns\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse tokio::sync::RwLock;\r\nuse std::sync::Arc;\r\n\r\n// Concurrent operations\r\nasync fn process_multiple_agents(\r\n    agents: Vec<String>,\r\n    state: Arc<AppState>,\r\n) -> Vec<Result<Response, Error>> {\r\n    let futures = agents.into_iter().map(|agent_id| {\r\n        let state = Arc::clone(&state);\r\n        async move {\r\n            process_agent(&agent_id, &state).await\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    futures::future::join_all(futures).await\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Handling Strategy\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse thiserror::Error;\r\n\r\n#[derive(Error, Debug)]\r\npub enum HearthlinkError {\r\n    #[error(\"Database error: {0}\")]\r\n    Database(#[from] rusqlite::Error),\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"IO error: {0}\")]\r\n    Io(#[from] std::io::Error),\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"Agent not found: {0}\")]\r\n    AgentNotFound(String),\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"Invalid input: {0}\")]\r\n    InvalidInput(String),\r\n\r\n    #[error(\"LLM error: {0}\")]\r\n    LlmError(String),\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Convert to String for Tauri IPC\r\nimpl From<HearthlinkError> for String {\r\n    fn from(err: HearthlinkError) -> String {\r\n        err.to_string()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\n### Input Validation\r\n```rust\r\nfn validate_user_id(user_id: &str) -> Result<(), String> {\r\n    if user_id.is_empty() {\r\n        return Err(\"User ID cannot be empty\".to_string());\r\n    }\r\n    if user_id.len() > 255 {\r\n        return Err(\"User ID too long\".to_string());\r\n    }\r\n    if !user_id.chars().all(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || c == '-' || c == '_') {\r\n        return Err(\"User ID contains invalid characters\".to_string());\r\n    }\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Path Sanitization\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::path::{Path, PathBuf};\r\n\r\nfn safe_join(base: &Path, user_path: &str) -> Result<PathBuf, String> {\r\n    let path = base.join(user_path);\r\n\r\n    // Ensure the path is within base directory\r\n    let canonical = path.canonicalize()\r\n        .map_err(|_| \"Invalid path\".to_string())?;\r\n\r\n    if !canonical.starts_with(base) {\r\n        return Err(\"Path traversal attempt detected\".to_string());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Ok(canonical)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tauri Security Configuration\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"tauri\": {\r\n    \"allowlist\": {\r\n      \"all\": false,\r\n      \"fs\": {\r\n        \"scope\": [\"$APPDATA/*\", \"$APPDATA/**\"]\r\n      },\r\n      \"shell\": {\r\n        \"open\": true,\r\n        \"scope\": []\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing Patterns\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\n```rust\r\n#[cfg(test)]\r\nmod tests {\r\n    use super::*;\r\n\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn test_validate_user_id() {\r\n        assert!(validate_user_id(\"valid-user_123\").is_ok());\r\n        assert!(validate_user_id(\"\").is_err());\r\n        assert!(validate_user_id(\"user@invalid\").is_err());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #[tokio::test]\r\n    async fn test_create_task() {\r\n        let state = AppState::new_test();\r\n        let params = CreateTaskParams {\r\n            user_id: \"test-user\".to_string(),\r\n            title: \"Test Task\".to_string(),\r\n            description: None,\r\n            due_date: None,\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        let result = create_task(State::new(&state), params).await;\r\n        assert!(result.is_ok());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Common Tasks\r\n\r\n1. **Adding New IPC Commands**\r\n   - Define command parameters and response types\r\n   - Implement command handler

[ ] Verify SidebarChat 3-state functionality in browser\r\n2. [ ] Update ACTUAL_STATUS.md with current state\r\n3. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to VaultDashboard\r\n4. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to other module dashboards\r\n5. [ ] Address 8 accessibility E2E failures\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Alignment Checklist\r\n\r\n### Master Documentation Alignment\r\n\r\n- [x] Core Session architecture (Section 5) - Room/session management defined\r\n- [x] Persona memory isolation (Vault Section 4) - No cross-persona leakage\r\n- [x] UI Component standards (Appendix P) - React components with TypeScript\r\n- [x] Accessibility (Appendix U) - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support\r\n- [x] Expanded Chat spec (Appendix EE) - 4-column layout implemented\r\n\r\n### KISS Compliance\r\n\r\n- [x] Components have single responsibility\r\n- [x] State is lifted to appropriate level (dashboard manages sidebar state)\r\n- [x] Portal used for overlay instead of complex z-index management\r\n- [ ] Visual verification of all states pending\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_This document is the source of truth for current system state.

Using `createPortal(jsx, document.body)` renders it at the root level.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Module Resident AI Mapping\r\n\r\n| Module          | Resident AI | Color Theme      |\r\n| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |\r\n| Alden (default) | Alden       | Gold (#d6b369)   |\r\n| Core            | Alden       | Gold             |\r\n| Vault           | Sentry      | Red (#ef4444)    |\r\n| Alice           | Alice       | Blue (#3b82f6)   |\r\n| Mimic           | Mimic       | Purple (#a855f7) |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n1. **SidebarChat expand/collapse** - Buttons not fully wired; need visual verification\r\n2. **Ghost chat window** - May appear if UnifiedCommandCenter's default GlobalCommsStream shows behind custom sidebar\r\n3. **ACTUAL_STATUS.md** - Outdated (Oct 2025), needs update after current fixes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps (Priority Order)\r\n\r\n1. [ ] Verify SidebarChat 3-state functionality in browser\r\n2. [ ] Update ACTUAL_STATUS.md with current state\r\n3. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to VaultDashboard\r\n4. [ ] Apply SidebarChat to other module dashboards\r\n5. [ ] Address 8 accessibility E2E failures\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Alignment Checklist\r\n\r\n### Master Documentation Alignment\r\n\r\n- [x] Core Session architecture (Section 5) - Room/session management defined\r\n- [x] Persona memory isolation (Vault Section 4) - No cross-persona leakage\r\n- [x] UI Component standards (Appendix P) - React components with TypeScript\r\n- [x] Accessibility (Appendix U) - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support\r\n- [x] Expanded Chat spec (Appendix EE) - 4-column layout implemented\r\n\r\n### KISS Compliance\r\n\r\n- [x] Components have single responsibility\r\n- [x] State is lifted to appropriate level (dashboard manages sidebar state)\r\n- [x] Portal used for overlay instead of complex z-index management\r\n- [ ] Visual verification of all states pending\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_This document is the source of truth for current system state. Update after each significant change._\r\n"}}
