Mocks are swapped by changing manifest/environment selectors, not code.\\n\\n## Deliverables\\n### 1) Asset Loading System (Frontend)\\n- **Asset IDs:** Use logical IDs (string keys) everywhere in code, e.g., `character.duck.idle`, `bg.village.map`, `ui.event.popup`.\\n- **Manifest:** A single JSON manifest (generated from `ASSET_MANIFEST.md` or a build step) maps IDs to `{ type, url, mockUrl, meta }`.\\n- **Resolver:** `resolveAsset(id, mode)` returns `url` based on `mode = 'real' | 'mock' | 'auto'`.\\n  - `auto` selects real if available, otherwise mock (fallback).\\n- **Loader:** `AssetStore` handles async load, caching, and error fallback.\\n  - `load(id)` returns a Promise of an Asset (image, atlas, audio).\\n  - Cache key is `{id, resolvedUrl}` to allow mode changes without stale collisions.\\n- **Preload Strategy:** Scene-level preloads (village, home, cottage) with progress callbacks and timeout fallback to mock.\\n- **Validation:** On boot, verify all manifest entries resolve to reachable files; log missing real assets and confirm mock fallback.\\n\\n### 2) Phase 2 Implementation Steps (Core Game Loops)\\n1. **Core Loop:** Implement fixed-timestep update loop + render loop (requestAnimationFrame).\\n2. **Scene System:** Scene manager with lifecycle (`init`, `enter`, `update`, `render`, `exit`).\\n3. **Village Rendering:** Tile or layered image renderer for the Village Map asset; integrate parallax or layers if provided.\\n4. **Character State Machine:** Idle/Happy/Sad states, plus transitions and timers. Add animation frame scheduler per state.\\n5. **Interaction Layer:** Basic input mapping (click/tap) to state transitions and event triggers.\\n6. **UI/Event Mock Integration:** UI overlay system with mock assets for event prompts; no gameplay logic yet beyond display.\\n7. **Save/Load Stub:** Local state serialization stub (character mood, location) to prepare for persistence.\\n\\n### 3) Mock Handling Strategy\\n- **Mode Flag:** `ASSET_MODE` env/config with values `real`, `mock`, `auto`.\\n- **Resolver Policy:** `auto` resolves to real when present; falls back to mock for missing real assets. No code changes required.\\n- **Build Profiles:** Dev defaults to `auto`, CI can run `mock` for reliability, Release uses `real` with validation gating.\\n- **Manifest Fields:** `{ url, mockUrl, status }` to allow tooling to report coverage and missing assets.\\n- **Testing:** Unit test resolver behavior; runtime check logs warnings for real asset misses but does not crash.\\n\\n## Status\\n[COMPLETE]\\n'@ | Set-Content -Path '.agent/staging/responses/AGENT_1_ARCHITECT.md'\\n\",\"workdir\":\"d:\\\\Game builds\\\\Pixel Pal\"}","call_id":"call_GJA6gRS9bl4SFPSGqm8XJeBQ"}}
