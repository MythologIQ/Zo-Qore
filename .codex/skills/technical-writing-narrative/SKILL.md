# Technical Writing Narrative

## Overview

Produce succinct technical documents with verified claims and a clear narrative arc (conception, development, life beyond).

## Workflow

1. Confirm audience, purpose, medium, and source of truth (repo, specs, tickets).
2. List claims and map each to a source. Remove or qualify anything unverified.
3. Build a tight outline: problem, concept, implementation, current capabilities, future.
4. Write in short, high-signal sentences. Prefer verbs over adjectives.
5. Validate names, commands, settings, and paths against code or docs.
6. Trim for brevity: remove filler, consolidate, tighten.

## Source Precedence

When sources conflict, use this order:

1. Runtime behavior or tests (if reproducible in current repo state)
2. Source code in the current branch
3. Versioned governance artifacts (roadmap, backlog, changelog, release notes)
4. Tickets/discussion notes

If conflicts remain unresolved, mark claim status as `unknown` and document conflict.

## Claim-to-Source Mapping

For docs with consequential claims, include a compact claim map:

```markdown
| Claim | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|
| ... | implemented/in_progress/planned/deferred/unknown | path:line or artifact id |
```

Use file references when possible (`path:line`) and avoid uncited claims.

## Narrative Arc

- Conception: problem, constraints, why existing options are insufficient.
- Development: key decisions, tradeoffs, architecture, governance.
- Life beyond: roadmap, extension points, contribution pathways.

## Brevity Rules

- Use the fewest words that preserve accuracy.
- Prefer active voice and concrete nouns.
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences.
- Avoid hype, promises, and metrics without sources.

## Accuracy Checklist

- Only claim features that exist in code or shipped docs.
- Match command titles, IDs, and settings exactly.
- Confirm config paths and defaults.
- Label unknowns as planned or experimental only if sources say so.
- Resolve conflicting sources using the precedence model.
- Mark every forward-looking statement as `planned` or `deferred` with source.

## Status Labels (Required)

Use one of these labels for any feature, workflow, or roadmap claim:

- `implemented` - Exists in current code/docs and is verifiable now.
- `in_progress` - Active work with partial implementation evidence.
- `planned` - Approved/recorded work not yet implemented.
- `deferred` - Explicitly postponed work with a recorded reason.
- `unknown` - Insufficient or conflicting evidence.

Do not use ambiguous labels like "done-ish", "coming soon", or "mostly complete".

## Forward-Looking Guardrails

- Do not present roadmap items as commitments unless explicitly stated in source artifacts.
- Tie all future claims to a concrete source (`BACKLOG`, roadmap entry, plan file, or ticket).
- If no source exists, remove the claim or mark as `unknown`.

## Output Patterns

- README: value statement, quick links, architecture or core systems, beta notice.
- Extension listing: problem, solution, features, commands, configuration, privacy, requirements.
- Release notes: Added, Changed, Fixed with scoped, factual bullets.
