# SRE Causal RCA

## Purpose
Perform hypothesis-driven incident analysis to identify causal chains and validated root causes.

## Use This Skill When
- Investigating production incidents or severe regressions.
- Correlating logs, metrics, traces, and deployment events.
- Producing post-incident corrective action plans.

## Workflow
1. Define incident timeline and impact boundaries.
2. Form causal hypotheses and required evidence.
3. Query logs/metrics/traces to validate or falsify hypotheses.
4. Isolate primary and contributing causes.
5. Document corrective/preventive actions with owners.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Incident RCA and reliability hypothesis testing.

**Out of scope**
- Feature design/development workflows.
