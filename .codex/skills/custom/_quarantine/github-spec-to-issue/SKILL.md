# GitHub Spec to Issue

## Purpose
Translate technical specs into implementation-ready GitHub issue plans with dependencies and ordering.

## Use This Skill When
- You have a spec and need actionable issue breakdown.
- You need dependency-aware task sequencing.

## Workflow
1. Parse spec sections into deliverable units.
2. Derive issue granularity, acceptance criteria, and labels.
3. Build dependency graph and critical path ordering.
4. Emit prioritized issue set and milestone grouping.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Spec decomposition and issue graph planning.

**Out of scope**
- Actual code implementation.
