# WCAG Audit Patterns

## Purpose
Run structured WCAG pattern audits and produce implementation-level remediation outputs.

## Use This Skill When
- Performing repeatable accessibility audits.
- Converting WCAG findings into development tasks.

## Workflow
1. Audit key flows against POUR dimensions.
2. Capture defects with criterion mapping.
3. Generate prioritized remediation actions.
4. Re-verify and close findings.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- WCAG pattern audits and remediation plans.

**Out of scope**
- Broader UX journey analysis outside accessibility criteria.
