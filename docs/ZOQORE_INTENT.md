# Zo-Qore Intent

Zo-Qore is the Zo-native interface and runtime control surface for QoreLogic.

The project exists to make governance-first execution practical in day-to-day work. It keeps policy, risk, ledger, and decision contracts explicit, testable, and independent from any single host UI.

This repository is also where the community can see exactly how decisions are enforced, how prompts are assembled, and how runtime actions are validated before execution.

## Why It Matters

- Safety is not hidden behind a black box.
- Prompt generation and dispatch are visible, reviewable, and auditable.
- The same core runtime can serve both Zo-native workflows and local IDE adapter workflows.

## Community Thanks

Thank you to everyone who tests, audits, and contributes here.

Your bug reports, adversarial reviews, and pull requests make the project stronger for the entire open source community.
