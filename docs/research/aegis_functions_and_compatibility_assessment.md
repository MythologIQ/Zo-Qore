# AEGIS Functions and Compatibility – Research Summary

**Identified Questions:** The research overview poses questions such as:  
- **What core functionalities should AEGIS implement?** (e.g. error injection methods, evaluation, etc.)  
- **Which multi-agent frameworks must AEGIS support for compatibility?**  
- **Which LLM/API services and environments must AEGIS interoperate with?**  

**Core Functions:** AEGIS centers on *error injection and detection* in multi-agent systems. Its core components include a **Malicious Factory** that generates errors via different strategies. For example, the factory supports *prompt injection* (modifying agent inputs), *response corruption* (altering outputs), and *context-aware attacks* (tailoring injections by task/role)【64†L433-L438】. In addition, AEGIS provides evaluation utilities and examples (e.g. `basic_error_injection.py`, `multi_framework_evaluation.py`) to test models on injected errors. In summary, AEGIS must implement functions for (1) generating diverse error scenarios, (2) wrapping multiple MAS environments, and (3) evaluating error-detection performance【64†L433-L438】【65†L345-L348】.  

**MAS Framework Compatibility:** AEGIS is explicitly designed to work across many multi-agent frameworks. Its codebase includes interfaces and adapters for frameworks like **DyLAN**, **AgentVerse**, **LLM Debate**, **MacNet**, and a specialized **Magnetic-One** integration【74†L363-L370】【64†L444-L448】. The documentation states that AEGIS provides “standardized interfaces for various MAS frameworks” including all of the above【64†L444-L448】. Thus, AEGIS should be compatible with any MAS platform that can be wrapped (via `agent_systems/` or `methods/` modules) into its unified interface. The quick-start architecture confirms support for DyLAN, AgentVerse, LLM-based debate agents, MacNet topologies, etc【74†L363-L370】. In practice, ensuring compatibility means testing AEGIS in each framework’s environment and providing the necessary wrappers and configuration (the repo even includes separate `configs/` for each)【74†L363-L370】【64†L444-L448】.  

**LLM/API Compatibility:** The AEGIS framework also relies on language model APIs for generating injection instructions and simulating agents. The configuration clearly shows support for major LLM services: it requires API keys for **OpenAI (GPT)**, **Google/Gemini**, **Azure OpenAI**, and **Anthropic/Claude**【67†L504-L513】【74†L504-L512】. For example, the `.env` template expects `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`【67†L504-L513】. This means AEGIS must be compatible with those platforms’ endpoints and SDKs. In practice, users must supply credentials for the LLM providers they intend to use. The example model configuration shows it can call models like `gpt-4o-mini` or `gemini-2.0-flash` via HTTP APIs【74†L529-L538】.  

**Unresolved Gaps / Open Issues:** While the above answers are supported by the repository docs, some gaps remain. For instance, an open issue notes that the example scripts have a broken import: the class `MaliciousSystem` (used in `basic_error_injection.py` and `main.py`) is not found in the code【70†L216-L220】. This suggests outdated example code or a missing implementation. Another query in the repo (closed without resolution) concerned *how* the system continues agent execution after injecting an error. These indicate that some design details and example correctness have yet to be clarified or fixed. Further investigation is needed to resolve these discrepancies and to test compatibility with each listed framework and API in practice.

**Sources:** The answers above are based on the AEGIS repository’s README and code. For example, the README’s *Core Components* section describes the error injection methods【64†L433-L438】, and the *Multi-Agent System Wrappers* section lists all supported frameworks【64†L444-L448】. Configuration sections list the required LLM API keys【67†L504-L513】. An open GitHub issue highlights the missing `MaliciousSystem` class in examples【70†L216-L220】.
