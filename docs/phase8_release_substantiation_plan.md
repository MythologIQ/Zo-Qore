# Phase 8 Plan: Release Substantiation and Audit Bundle

## Objective

Consolidate implementation evidence, adversarial findings, and readiness controls into an auditable release bundle.

Status: `implemented`

## Scope

In scope:
- Structured status-map updates for new controls.
- Phase substantiation references for phases 5-8.
- Consolidated adversarial review iteration tracking.

Out of scope:
- External legal/compliance attestation processes.

## Deliverables

1. Updated `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md` with status-labeled claims.
2. Phase 5 substantiation artifact and links.
3. Phase 6-9 adversarial review record.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Every consequential claim has status and source.
2. New release controls have linked evidence artifacts.
3. Adversarial review state is explicit for all completed phases.
