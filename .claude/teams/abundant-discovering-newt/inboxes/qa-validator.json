The task chain:\n- chaos-tester is now implementing Task #4 (Chaos Testing)\n- Once Task #4 completes, your Task #5 (Final QA) will be unblocked\n\n**What to do now:**\n1. Monitor `TaskList` to see when Task #5 becomes available (blockedBy will be empty)\n2. Review the existing codebase while waiting:\n   - IPC server security: src/ipc/server.rs\n   - Backend implementation: src/engine/gguf/\n   - Tokenizer integration: src/engine/tokenizer.rs\n3. When Task #5 is unblocked, claim it and execute:\n   - Full test suite: `cargo test`\n   - Section 4 Razor audit (≤40 line functions, ≤250 line files, ≤3 nesting)\n   - Security boundary validation (IPC auth, filesystem isolation, network denial)\n   - Performance baseline (throughput, latency, memory)\n\nThe team is 3/5 tasks complete. We're in the home stretch—chaos tests → QA → done.\n\nStand by and monitor TaskList.",

    "text": "🎉 **Task #5 UNBLOCKED — Start Final QA Now**\n\nchaos-tester just completed 53 comprehensive chaos tests across 4 files:\n- IPC protocol fault injection ✅\n- Token stream interruptions ✅\n- Scheduler/queue resilience ✅\n- Shutdown/health/resource limits ✅\n\nAll Section 4 Razor compliant. **Your turn!**\n\n**Execute Task #5 immediately:**\n1. Claim the task from TaskList if not auto-assigned: `TaskUpdate(taskId: \"2\", owner: \"qa-validator\")`\n2. Run full test suite:\n   ```bash\n   cd /g/MythologIQ/CORE/core-runtime\n   cargo test --all\n   ```\n3. Code audit checklist:\n   - Section 4 Razor: scan all files for ≤250 lines, ≤40 line functions, ≤3 nesting\n   - New tests from chaos suite: verify they meet compliance\n4. Security validation:\n   - IPC auth: verify connection guard and protocol compliance\n   - Filesystem: models/, tokenizers/ read-only; temp/, cache/ write-only; deny all else\n   - Network: zero listening ports, zero outbound connections\n5. Performance baseline:\n   - Single inference latency\n   - Batch throughput (if applicable)\n   - Memory footprint (peak usage)\n6. Documentation:\n   - Verify all public APIs have doc comments\n   - Check CLAUDE.md compliance\n\nReport findings and mark task as completed when all validations pass.\n\nWork autonomously—you're the final gatekeeper before Meta-LEDGER Entry #17.",
