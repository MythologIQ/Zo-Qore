All tests pass.\n\n**Summary**: 53 chaos tests across 4 files, all Section 4 Razor compliant (under 250 lines each).\n\n**Test files**:\n- `tests/chaos_resilience_test.rs` (168 lines, 13 tests) - IPC protocol fault injection: random bytes, truncated JSON, type confusion, extreme payloads, binary protocol chaos, token encoding edge cases\n- `tests/chaos_stream_model_test.rs` (167 lines, 15 tests) - Token stream interruptions (sender/receiver drop, buffer overflow, rapid create/close), model loading failures (path traversal, nonexistent paths, directory escapes), tokenizer boundary conditions\n- `tests/chaos_scheduler_shutdown_test.rs` (130 lines, 7 tests) - Queue flooding, concurrent enqueue/dequeue, expired request skipping, inference engine context/param validation, concurrent inference\n- `tests/chaos_shutdown_health_test.rs` (241 lines, 18 tests) - Shutdown drain/timeout/concurrent tracking, health check under degraded/unhealthy states, resource limit enforcement (memory, concurrency, RAII release), connection pool concurrent stress, combined stress scenarios\n\n**Changes from original**: Refactored the original 1084-line single file into 4 Razor-compliant files. Fixed binary roundtrip test (bincode doesn't support serde tagged enums). Added new tests: binary protocol chaos, tokenizer boundary conditions, resource zero/exact boundary. Merged some redundant resource tests.\n\nTask #2 (Final QA) is now unblocked.",
