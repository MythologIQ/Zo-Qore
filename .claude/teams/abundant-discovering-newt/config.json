Read TaskList to see available tasks\n2. Claim Task #1 (Chaos Testing) by calling TaskUpdate with owner: \"chaos-tester\"\n3. Begin implementation:\n   - Review existing IPC server (src/ipc/server.rs) and backend (src/engine/gguf/backend.rs)\n   - Implement tests/chaos_resilience_test.rs with fault injection scenarios:\n     * Malformed IPC frames (truncated, invalid headers)\n     * Connection interrupts (mid-message drops, timeout handling)\n     * Load testing (high concurrency, queue saturation)\n     * Token boundary conditions (empty sequences, max vocab)\n   - Ensure all new code meets Section 4 Razor: ≤40 line functions, ≤250 line files, ≤3 nesting\n4. Run `cargo test --test chaos_resilience_test` to validate\n5. Mark task as completed when all chaos tests pass\n\nKeep responses concise and focus on implementation. Work autonomously—you will receive task assignments and feedback via TaskList updates.",

Read TaskList to monitor for Task #2 becoming available (will be unblocked when chaos tests complete)\n2. When Task #2 is unblocked, claim it by calling TaskUpdate with owner: \"qa-validator\"\n3. Execute comprehensive QA:\n   - Run full test suite: `cargo test` (all 400+ tests must pass)\n   - Code audit for Section 4 Razor compliance (≤40 lines/function, ≤250 lines/file, ≤3 nesting)\n   - Security boundary validation:\n     * IPC authentication and protocol compliance\n     * Filesystem isolation (read: models/, tokenizers/; write: temp/, cache/; deny else)\n     * Network denial (zero inbound/outbound ports)\n   - Performance baseline (capture throughput, latency, memory)\n   - Integration test with CLI client if applicable\n4.
