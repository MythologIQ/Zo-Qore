# A.E.G.I.S. Self-Audit Report

**Auditor**: The QoreLogic Judge
**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Target**: QoreLogic Claude Adaptation Framework
**Risk Grade**: L2 (Logic changes, framework design)

---

## VERDICT: PASS (with recommendations)

---

## Executive Summary

The QoreLogic A.E.G.I.S. framework adaptation for Claude Code has been audited against its own principles. The framework is structurally sound, provides comprehensive coverage of the development lifecycle, and correctly implements both macro and micro KISS evaluation. Minor recommendations are provided for enhancement.

## Section 4 Razor Compliance (Micro KISS)

### Subagent Files

| File | Lines | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| ql-governor.md | ~150 | OK PASS |
| ql-judge.md | ~200 | OK PASS |
| ql-specialist.md | ~220 | OK PASS |

### Skill Files

| File | Lines | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| ql-bootstrap.md | ~180 | OK PASS |
| ql-status.md | ~170 | OK PASS |
| ql-audit.md | ~220 | OK PASS |
| ql-implement.md | ~250 | OK PASS (at limit) |
| ql-refactor.md | ~240 | OK PASS |
| ql-validate.md | ~200 | OK PASS |
| ql-substantiate.md | ~230 | OK PASS |

**Finding**: All documentation files within 250-line limit. `ql-implement.md` is at the boundary - monitor for growth.

### Macro KISS (Project Structure)

| Check | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Clear directory structure | OK PASS | subagents/, skills/, hooks/, templates/, docs/ |
| Single responsibility | OK PASS | Each file has one purpose |
| No God Objects | OK PASS | No combined persona/skill files |
| Dependency minimization | OK PASS | Zero external dependencies |

---

## Iteration Support Audit

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Linear chain design | OK PASS | No branching in Merkle chain |
| Iteration markers | OK PASS | Entry includes iteration number |
| ENCODE_UPDATE support | OK PASS | Documented in iteration guide |
| Content drift tolerance | OK PASS | Old hashes may not match (expected) |
| Chain validation | OK PASS | Only checks hash sequence |

**Finding**: Merkle chain correctly supports iterative development.

---

## Gap Analysis

### Gaps Identified from Zo Framework

| Gap | Status | Resolution |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Duplicate rule file | OK FIXED | Not carried over to Claude adaptation |
| Missing tool definitions | OK FIXED | Skills use Claude Code native tools |
| TBD path placeholders | OK FIXED | Concrete paths specified |
| Error recovery spec | OK FIXED | Recovery documented in iteration guide |
| Test framework | WARN PARTIAL | TDD-Light defined but no test runner integration |

### Remaining Gaps (Minor)

1. **Test Runner Integration**: Skills describe TDD-Light but don't integrate with specific test runners (jest, pytest, etc.). This is intentional for framework agnosticism but could be enhanced.

2. **CI/CD Integration**: No explicit CI/CD pipeline integration. The framework is designed for local development.

3. **Multi-User Support**: Linear chain doesn't support parallel development. This is documented as a limitation.

---

## Security Path Audit

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| L3 escalation for security paths | OK PASS |
| Blocking modifications on auth/* | OK PASS |
| Stub detection patterns | OK PASS |
| Seal requirement for L3 | OK PASS |

**Finding**: Security paths are properly gated.

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Should Implement)

1. **Add `/ql-test` skill**: Integrate TDD-Light with common test runners
2. **Add iteration field to all entries**: Currently shown in templates but not enforced

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)

3. **Add `/ql-diff` skill**: Show what changed since last seal
4. **Add CI hook examples**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI templates
5. **Add recovery skill**: `/ql-repair` for chain breaks

### Priority 3 (Future Consideration)

6. **Multi-user protocol**: Optional lightweight branching for teams
7. **Metrics dashboard**: Aggregate Section 4 compliance over time
8. **Integration with existing tools**: ESLint rules for Section 4 enforcement

## Disposition

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Verdict** | PASS |
| **Risk Grade** | L2 |
| **Chain Status** | Ready for initialization |
| **Recommended Actions** | Minor enhancements (Priority 1-2) |
