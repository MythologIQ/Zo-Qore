# ADR Manager

## Purpose
Standardize architecture decision capture with context, options, tradeoffs, and consequences.

## Use This Skill When
- Recording major technical decisions.
- Evaluating alternative architectures.
- Tracking rationale for future maintenance and onboarding.

## Workflow
1. Define decision context and constraints.
2. Enumerate options with tradeoffs.
3. Select decision with rationale and risk notes.
4. Record consequences and follow-up actions.
5. Link ADR to implementation artifacts and related ADRs.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Decision-record authoring and ADR lifecycle management.

**Out of scope**
- Direct implementation tasks without architecture decision capture.
