# ElevenLabs Sound Effects

## Purpose
Create non-speech audio effects for interface, ambience, and cinematic feedback.

## Use This Skill When
- Generating UI sounds and interaction feedback.
- Producing ambient loops or one-shot impacts.
- Filling missing SFX assets during prototyping.

## Workflow
1. Specify effect intent, duration, and texture.
2. Generate variants and compare perceptual quality.
3. Tune prompt influence/looping for deployment context.
4. Normalize levels and export selected assets.

## Guardrails
- Avoid clipping and loudness inconsistency across assets.
- Test effects in target playback environment.
- Keep naming and metadata consistent for asset retrieval.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Non-speech sound-effect generation and effect asset tuning.

**Out of scope**
- Full music composition generation (use `elevenlabs-music`).
