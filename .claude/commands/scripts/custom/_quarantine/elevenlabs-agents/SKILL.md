# ElevenLabs Voice Agents

## Purpose
Design and implement conversational voice-agent workflows using ElevenLabs agent capabilities.

## Use This Skill When
- Building a voice assistant or call bot.
- Defining dialog flow, turn-taking, and interruption behavior.
- Integrating voice agents into product workflows.

## Workflow
1. Define user intent classes and target outcomes.
2. Design conversation states and fallback paths.
3. Configure voice, latency, and interruption settings.
4. Add observability for conversation quality and failure states.

## Guardrails
- Handle unclear intent with safe fallback responses.
- Ensure escalation path for high-risk interactions.
- Keep prompts concise and deterministic for production use.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Voice-agent conversation design and runtime behavior for ElevenLabs agents.

**Out of scope**
- API key setup and credential lifecycle (use `elevenlabs-setup-api-key`).
- Non-agent audio generation tasks (use STT/TTS/music/SFX skills).
