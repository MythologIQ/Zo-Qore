# RICE WSJF Scorer

## Purpose
Provide consistent backlog prioritization through RICE/WSJF style scoring.

## Use This Skill When
- Grooming backlog for planning cycles.
- Resolving priority conflicts across initiatives.

## Workflow
1. Normalize candidate work items and objective metadata.
2. Compute score inputs (reach/impact/confidence/effort or WSJF factors).
3. Rank items and flag sensitivity to uncertain assumptions.
4. Publish ordered backlog with rationale.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Prioritization scoring and ranking output.

**Out of scope**
- Product strategy definition itself.
