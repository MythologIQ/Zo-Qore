# ElevenLabs Music Generation

## Purpose
Generate music assets aligned to mood, timing, and product context.

## Use This Skill When
- Creating background tracks or stingers.
- Prototyping musical direction for features.
- Producing AI-assisted compositions for demos.

## Workflow
1. Define mood, tempo, and duration requirements.
2. Generate candidate tracks with prompt/composition controls.
3. Evaluate fit against scene, pacing, and loop behavior.
4. Select and document final track metadata.

## Guardrails
- Keep generation prompts specific and testable.
- Validate loop points when used in repeated playback.
- Track licensing/attribution requirements for distribution.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Music-track generation and scoring workflows.

**Out of scope**
- UI/interaction sound effect generation (use `elevenlabs-sound-effects`).
