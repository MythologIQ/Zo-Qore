# Agentic Threat Modeler

## Purpose
Threat-model agentic systems with explicit trust boundaries and abuse-case analysis.

## Use This Skill When
- Designing or reviewing multi-agent architectures.
- Assessing tool invocation and prompt-injection attack paths.

## Workflow
1. Enumerate agents, tools, and trust boundaries.
2. Identify attack vectors (prompt injection, data exfiltration, tool abuse).
3. Score risks by likelihood/impact and required controls.
4. Define mitigation controls and monitoring signals.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Agent-system threat modeling and control planning.

**Out of scope**
- Generic code vuln scanning without agent boundary context.
