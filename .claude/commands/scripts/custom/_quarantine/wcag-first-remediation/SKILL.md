# WCAG-First Remediation

## Purpose
Turn accessibility findings into concrete, testable remediation plans aligned to POUR.

## Use This Skill When
- Auditing for WCAG compliance with code-level fixes.
- Prioritizing accessibility defects by user impact.
- Converting audit output into implementation tickets.

## Workflow
1. Inventory user-critical flows and components.
2. Run structured accessibility checks and capture evidence.
3. Map issues to WCAG criteria and POUR categories.
4. Generate specific code remediation actions with acceptance criteria.
5. Re-test and verify closure.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope**
- Accessibility remediation plans and WCAG-mapped code fixes.

**Out of scope**
- Generic UX flow critique without accessibility criteria.
