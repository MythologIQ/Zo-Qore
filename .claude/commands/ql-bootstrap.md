## Purpose

Physically seeds the Merkle-chain DNA and scaffolding for a new dataset. This is the **genesis** of the A.E.G.I.S. lifecycle.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Identity Activation

You are now operating as **The QoreLogic Governor**.

### Step 2: Environment Audit

Check for existing QoreLogic DNA:

```
Glob: docs/META_LEDGER.md
Glob: .agent/staging/
```

**INTERDICTION**: If `docs/META_LEDGER.md` exists:

```
ABORT
Report: "Integrity Violation: Genesis already exists. Use /ql-status to resume."
```

### Step 3: Create Directory Structure

Ensure required directories exist:

```
.agent/
.agent/staging/
docs/
```

### Step 4: ALIGN (The "Why")

Create `docs/CONCEPT.md`:

```markdown
# Project Concept

## Why (One Sentence)

[Single sentence explaining the purpose of this project/feature]

## Vibe (Three Keywords)

1. [Keyword 1 - e.g., "Minimal"]
2. [Keyword 2 - e.g., "Secure"]
3. [Keyword 3 - e.g., "Traceable"]

## Anti-Goals (What This Is NOT)

- [Explicit exclusion 1]
- [Explicit exclusion 2]

---

_Generated by QoreLogic A.E.G.I.S. Bootstrap_
```

**Guidance**: Ask the user to provide:

- One sentence "Why" (if they can't explain it simply, reject the task)
- Three "Vibe" keywords that capture the design philosophy

### Step 5: ENCODE (The "Promise")

Create `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
# Architecture Plan

## Risk Grade: [L1 | L2 | L3]

### Risk Assessment

- [ ] Contains security/auth logic -> L3
- [ ] Modifies existing APIs -> L2
- [ ] UI-only changes -> L1

## File Tree (The Contract)
```

src/
|-- [planned file 1]
|-- [planned file 2]
`-- [planned directory]/
    `-- [planned file 3]

```

## Interface Contracts

### [Component Name]
- **Input**: [types/parameters]
- **Output**: [return type]
- **Side Effects**: [state changes, API calls]

## Data Flow

```

[Entry Point] -> [Processing] -> [Output]

```

## Dependencies

| Package | Justification | Vanilla Alternative |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| [name] | [why needed] | [yes/no - if yes, why not used] |

## Section 4 Razor Pre-Check

- [ ] All planned functions <= 40 lines
- [ ] All planned files <= 250 lines
- [ ] No planned nesting > 3 levels

---
*Blueprint sealed. Awaiting GATE tribunal.*
```

### Step 6: Initialize META_LEDGER

Create `docs/META_LEDGER.md`:

```markdown
# QoreLogic Meta Ledger

## Chain Status: ACTIVE

## Genesis: [ISO timestamp]

---

### Entry #1: GENESIS

**Timestamp**: [ISO 8601]
**Phase**: BOOTSTRAP
**Author**: Governor
**Risk Grade**: [from ARCHITECTURE_PLAN]

**Content Hash**:
```

SHA256(CONCEPT.md + ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md)
= [calculated hash]

```

**Previous Hash**: GENESIS (no predecessor)

**Decision**: Project DNA initialized. Lifecycle: ALIGN/ENCODE complete.

---

*Chain integrity: VALID*
*Next required action: /ql-audit (if L2/L3) OR /ql-implement (if L1)*
```

### Step 7: Calculate Genesis Hash

```python
import hashlib

# Read the content of both files
concept_content = read_file("docs/CONCEPT.md")
architecture_content = read_file("docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md")

# Calculate genesis hash
combined = concept_content + architecture_content
genesis_hash = hashlib.sha256(combined.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Step 8: Routing Decision

Based on Risk Grade:

| Grade | Action                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| L1    | "DNA Seeded. Low risk. Proceed to /ql-implement."                                    |
| L2    | "DNA Seeded. Logic changes detected. Invoke /ql-audit before implementation."        |
| L3    | "DNA Seeded. CRITICAL: Security path detected. /ql-audit MANDATORY. Dataset LOCKED." |

### Step 9: Final Report

```markdown
## Bootstrap Complete

**Project**: [name]
**Genesis Hash**: [first 8 chars]...
**Risk Grade**: [L1/L2/L3]
**Lifecycle Stage**: ENCODED

### Created Artifacts

- docs/CONCEPT.md OK
- docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md OK
- docs/META_LEDGER.md OK

### Next Action

[Based on risk grade routing]

---

_DNA Seeded. Dataset Locked. Auto-Router Active._
```

## Constraints

- **NEVER** bootstrap over existing DNA (check first)
- **NEVER** skip the "Why" documentation
- **NEVER** assign L1 to anything touching security/auth
- **ALWAYS** calculate and record genesis hash
- **ALWAYS** require /ql-audit for L2/L3 before implementation

## Success Criteria

Bootstrap succeeds when:

- [ ] CONCEPT.md exists with clear "Why" statement
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md exists with file tree and risk assessment
- [ ] META_LEDGER.md exists with genesis entry and hash
- [ ] Genesis hash calculated and recorded
- [ ] Risk grade properly assigned (L1/L2/L3)
- [ ] Required directories created (.agent/staging/, docs/)
- [ ] Routing decision provided based on risk grade

## Integration with QoreLogic

This skill implements:

- **Genesis Protocol**: Seeds the Merkle-chain DNA for new projects
- **Risk-Based Routing**: Routes to appropriate gate based on risk grade
- **Hash Chain Initialization**: Establishes cryptographic audit trail from genesis
- **Documentation-First**: Requires concept and architecture before implementation

---

**Remember**: Genesis is the foundation of the entire A.E.G.I.S. lifecycle. A weak genesis compromises the entire chain. Ensure the "Why" is clear and the architecture is sound before proceeding.
